.TH HOBBIT-ACKINFO.CGI 1 "Version 4.2:  7 Aug 2006" "Hobbit Monitor"
.SH NAME
hobbit-ackinfo.cgi \- Hobbit CGI script to acknowledge alerts
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "hobbit-ackinfo.cgi"

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBhobbit-ackinfo.cgi\fR is invoked as a CGI script via the 
hobbit-ackinfo.sh CGI wrapper.

hobbit-ackinfo.cgi is used to acknowledge an alert on the Hobbit
"Critical Systems" view, generated by the
.I hobbit-nkview.cgi(1)
utility. This allows the staff viewing the Critical Systems view to 
acknowledge alerts with a "Level 1" alert, thereby removing the
alert from the Critical Systems view.

Note that the Level 1 alert generated by the hobbit-ackinfo.cgi
utility does \fBNOT\fR stop alerts from being sent.

In a future version of Hobbit (after Hobbit 4.2), this utility
will also be used for acknowledging alerts at other levels.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--level=NUMBER"
Sets the acknowledgment level. This is typically used to force a specific
level of the acknowledgment, e.g. a level 1 acknowledge when called from the
Critical Systems view.

.IP "--validity=TIME"
Sets the validity of the acknowledgment. By default this is taken from the
CGI parameters supplied by the user.

.IP "--sender=STRING"
