<h3><a name="noclient">My client-side tests dont show up on the webpages</a></h3>
<p>Did you install a client ? The Hobbit client package is installed
automatically only on the Hobbit server - on other systems, you must
build the client package by running Hobbit's configure-script with
the <tt>&quot;--client&quot;</tt> option and build the client package on the hosts you
want to monitor.</p>

<p>If you did install a client, then the two most probable causes for 
this are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The client is using another hostname than what is in the bb-hosts file.<br>
	Hobbit only cares about the hosts that are in the bb-hosts file, and
	discards status-reports from unknown hosts. If you check the "hobbitd"
	column on the webserver display for the Hobbit server, you will see 
	a report about these unknown hosts.<br>
	Either reconfigure the client to use the same hostname as is in the
	bb-hosts file, or add a <tt>CLIENT:clienthostname</tt> tag in the
	bb-hosts file so Hobbit knows what host matches the client hostname.
	The Hobbit client can be started with a <tt>&quot;--hostname=MYHOSTNAME&quot;</tt>
	option to explicitly define the hostname that the client uses when
	reporting data to Hobbit.</li>

	<li>A firewall is blocking the client access to the Hobbit server.<br>
	Clients must be able to connect to the Hobbit server on TCP port 1984
	to send their status reports. If this port is blocked by a firewall,
	client status reports will not show up.<br>
	If possible, open up the firewall to allow this access. Alternatively,
	you may setup a proxy using the <em>bbproxy</em> tool (part of Hobbit)
	to forward status messages from a protected network to the Hobbit
	server.<br>
	Other methods are also possible, e.g. <em>bbfetch</em> (available from
	the <a href="http://www.deadcat.net/">www.deadcat.net</a> archive.
</ul>

<h3><a name="clientnames">My silly clients are using a hostname different from the one in bb-hosts</a></h3>
<p>Add a <tt>CLIENT:clienthostname</tt> tag to the host entry in the bb-hosts file,
or re-configure the client to use the proper hostname.</p>

<h3><a name="apachetest">Getting the Apache performance graphs</a></h3>
<p>Charles Jones provided this recipe on the Hobbit mailing list:</p>
<pre><tt>
From: Charles Jones

Subject: Re: [hobbit] Apache tag

Okay, first you must make the indicated addition to your apache
httpd.conf (or you can make a hobbit.conf in apaches conf.d directory).
[ed: See the bb-hosts man-page for the "apache" description]

Then, you must restart apache for the change to take effect
(/etc/init.d/httpd restart).

Then, manually test the server-stats url to make sure it's working, by
using your browser and going to
http://your.server.com/server-status?auto  (you can also go to
http://your.server.com/server-status/ to get some nice extended apache
performance info).  You should get back something like this:

Total Accesses: 131577
Total kBytes: 796036
CPULoad: 1.0401
Uptime: 21595
ReqPerSec: 6.09294
BytesPerSec: 37746.7
BytesPerReq: 6195.16
BusyWorkers: 43
IdleWorkers: 13

Scoreboard: RR__RWR___RR_R_RR_RRRRRRRRR_RRRRRRR__RRR_RRRRCRRRRR_RRRR........................................................................................................................................................................................................

Now, assuming you are getting back the server-status info, time to make
sure your bb-hosts is correctly configured to collect and graph the
data.  Heres what I have in mine:

1.2.3.4    my.server.com  # conn ssh http://1.2.3.4 apache=http://1.2.3.4/server-status?auto TRENDS:*,apache:apache|apache1|apache2|apache3

 From what you said of your setup, I'm guessing your only problem is
 using the wrong url for the apache tag (you used
 "apache=http://192.168.1.25/hobbit/" which just won't work - that's the
 kind of URL you would use for the http tag).

 Hope this helped.

<hr>
<h3><a name="mrtg">How can I add MRTG graphs to the Hobbit webpages?</a></h3>
<p>There is <a href="hobbit-mrtg.html">a special document</a> for this, describing how you can configure
MRTG to save data in a format that Hobbit can handle natively.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="updatefreq">I need the web-pages to update more frequently</a></h3>
<p>The ~/server/etc/hobbitlaunch.cfg defines the update
interval for all of the Hobbit programs. The default is for
network tests to run every 5 minutes, and webpage updates to
happen once a minute.</p>
<p>Note that if you run the <em>bbretest-net.sh</em> tool
on your network test server (this is the default for a new
Hobbit server), then network tests that fail 
will run every minute for up to 30 minutes after the initial
failure, so usually there is little need to change the update
interval for your network tests.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="fahrenheit">I want my temperature graphs in Fahrenheit</a></h3>
<p>Edit the file server/etc/hobbitgraph.cfg, and change the <b>[temperature]</b>
definition from the default one to the one below that shows Fahrenheit graphs.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="nohtmllink">How do I remove the HTML links from the alert messages?</a></h3>
<p>Configure your alerts in server/etc/hobbit-alerts.cfg to use <tt>FORMAT=PLAIN</tt>
instead of TEXT.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="mancgi">I cannot see the man-pages on the web</a></h3>
<p>A common Apache configuration mistakenly believes any filename containing
".cgi" is a CGI-script, so it refuses to present the man-pages for the CGI
scripts. Stephen Beaudry found the solution:</p>
<pre>
   This occurs because by default, apache associates the cgi-script
   handler with any filename containing ".cgi".  I fixed this on my server
   by changing the following line in my httpd.conf

   AddHandler cgi-script .cgi     -&gt;to-&gt;    AddHandler cgi-script .cgi$
</pre>

<hr>
<h3><a name="rtl">Hobbit will not run due to missing libraries</a></h3>
<p>This is frequently a problem on Solaris, when you have installed the
extra libraries needed by Hobbit in /usr/local. By default, this directory
is NOT searched for libraries by the run-time linker, so your compile will
work just fine, but nothing will run.
<ul>
<li>On Solaris, use the command <tt><b>crle -u -v -l /usr/local/lib</b></tt>
to configure the run-time linker to also search this library.</li>
<li>On other systems, you can put <tt><b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib</b></tt>
in the etc/hobbitserver.cfg and etc/hobbitcgi.cfg to make it pick up the libraries
from /usr/local/lib.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="mailnosubj">My alert emails come without a subject</a></h3>
<p>Hobbit by default uses the system <b>mail</b> command to send out messages.
The mail-command in Solaris and HP-UX does not understand the "-s SUBJECT" syntax that Hobbit uses.
So you get mails with no subject. The solution is to change the MAIL setting in
etc/hobbitserver.cfg to use the <b>mailx</b> command instead. Hobbit needs to be
restarted after this change.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="snmptraps">Does Hobbit support receiving SNMP traps?</a></h3>
<p>Not directly, but there is other Open Source software available that can
handle SNMP traps. A very elegant method of feeding traps into Hobbit has been
described in <a href="http://cerebro.victoriacollege.edu/hobbit-trap.html">this
article</a> by Andy Farrior.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="scripts">How can I create a custom test script?</a></h3>
<p>Anything that can be automated via a script or a custom program can
be added into Hobbit. A lot of extension scripts are available for
Big Brother at the <a href="http://www.deadcat.net/">www.deadcat.net archive</a>,
and these will typically work without modifications if you run them in
Hobbit. Sometimes a few minor tweaks are needed - the Hobbit mailing list
can help you if you dont know how to go about that.</p>
<p>But if you have something unique you need to test, writing an extension
script is pretty simple. You need to figure out some things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What name will you use for the column?
  <li>How will you test it?
  <li>What criteria should decide if the test goes red, yellow or green?
  <li>What extra data from the test will you include in the status message ?
</ul>

<p>A simple <b>client-side</b> extension script looks like this:</p>
<pre><tt>
   #!/bin/sh

   COLUMN=mytest	# Name of the column
   COLOR=green		# By default, everything is OK
   MSG="Bad stuff status"

   # Do whatever you need to test for something
   # As an example, go red if /tmp/badstuff exists.
   if test -f /tmp/badstuff
   then
      COLOR=red
      MSG="${MSG}
 
      `cat /tmp/badstuff`
      "
   else
      MSG="${MSG}

      All is OK
      "
   fi

   # Tell Hobbit about it
   $BB $BBDISP "status $MACHINE.$COLUMN $COLOR `date`

   ${MSG}
   "

   exit 0
</tt></pre>

<p>You will notice that some environment variables are pre-defined:
BB, BBDISP, MACHINE are all provided by Hobbit when you run your script via
hobbitlaunch. Also note how the MSG variable is used to build the status
message - it starts out with just the "Bad stuff status", then you add
data to the message when we decided what the status is.</p>

<p>To run this, save your script in the ~hobbit/client/ext/ directory 
(i.e. in the ext/ directory off where you installed the Hobbit client),
then add a new section to the ~hobbit/client/etc/clientlaunch.cfg file
like this:</p>

<pre><tt>
   [myscript]
	ENVFILE $HOBBITCLIENTHOME/etc/hobbitclient.cfg
	CMD $HOBBITCLIENTHOME/ext/myscript.sh
	LOGFILE $HOBBITCLIENTHOME/logs/myscript.log
	INTERVAL 5m
</tt></pre>

<br><br>

<p><b>Server-side scripts</b> look almost the same, but they will
typically use the <a href="manpages/man1/bbhostgrep.1.html">bbhostgrep</a>
utility to pick out hosts in the bb-hosts file that have a special tag 
defined, and then send one status message for each of those hosts. 
Like this:</p>
<pre><tt>
   #!/bin/sh

   BBHTAG=foo           # What we put in bb-hosts to trigger this test
   COLUMN=$BBHTAG	# Name of the column, often same as tag in bb-hosts

   $BBHOME/bin/bbhostgrep $BBHTAG | while read L
   do
      set $L	# To get one line of output from bbhostgrep

      HOSTIP="$1"
      MACHINEDOTS="$2"
      MACHINE=`echo $2 | $SED -e's/\./,/g'`

      COLOR=green
      MSG="$BBHTAG status for host $MACHINEDOTS"

      #... do the test, perhaps modify COLOR and MSG

      $BB $BBDISP "status $MACHINE.$COLUMN $COLOR `date`

      ${MSG}
      "
    done

    exit 0
</tt></pre>

<p>Note that for server side tests, you need to loop over the list
of hosts found in the bb-hosts file, and send one status message for
each host. Other than that, it is just like the client-side tests.</p>
