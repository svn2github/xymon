\chapter{Preface}
\label{chap:preface}

System Monitoring is an important subject in a IT department.
With good system monitoring tool like Hobbit, it provides your IT
staff a tool to engage proactive system monitoring.

Service outages can be detectd quickly and even prevented by monitoring
hobbit closely.

I am turning hobbit man pages into a book using latex because following reasons

\begin{itemize}
\item RTFM: Read The Fine Manpage is the most direct and efficient way of
learning a Unix subject. But it is hard if you trying to read a set of manpages.
\item  when man pages about Hobbit is 58 from author Henry.
\item Problems of this approach is that manpage is not a book. it has no
Table of Content,Indexes to locate a term easily.

\end{itemize}

\section{This book is a work in progress}

I am writing this  book about hobbit from perspective of manpages.  

I am releasing this Hobbit RTFM book while I am still writing it, in the hope that
