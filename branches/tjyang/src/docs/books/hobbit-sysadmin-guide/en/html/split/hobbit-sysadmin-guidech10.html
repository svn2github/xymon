<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent">Mercurial offers a powerful mechanism to let you perform automated actions in response to events that occur in a repository. In
some cases, you can even control Mercurial&#x2019;s response to those events.
</p><!--l. 8--><p class="indent">   The name Mercurial uses for one of these actions is a <span

<!--l. 58--><p class="noindent">When you run a Mercurial command in a repository, and the command causes a hook to run, that hook runs on <span 
class="ptmri7t-">your </span>system,
under <span 
class="ptmri7t-">your </span>user account, with <span 
class="ptmri7t-">your </span>privilege level. Since hooks are arbitrary pieces of executable code, you should treat them
with an appropriate level of suspicion. Do not install a hook unless you are confident that you know who created it and what it
does.
</p><!--l. 65--><p class="indent">   In some cases, you may be exposed to hooks that you did not install yourself. If you work with Mercurial on an unfamiliar
system, Mercurial will run hooks defined in that system&#x2019;s global <a 
 id="dx14-200001"></a><a 
 id="dx14-200002"></a><span 
class="pcrr7tn-">hgrc</span>&#x00A0;file.
</p><!--l. 69--><p class="indent">   If you are working with a repository owned by another user, Mercurial can run hooks defined in that user&#x2019;s
repository, but it will still run them as &#x201C;you&#x201D;. For example, if you <a 
 id="dx14-200003"></a>&#x201C;<span 
class="pcrr7tn-">hg pull</span>&#x201D; from that repository, and its <a

 id="dx14-200006"></a><span

   <div class="fbox"><span

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">10.2.2    </span> <a 
 id="x14-20100010.2.2"></a>Hooks do not propagate</h4>
<!--l. 91--><p class="noindent">In Mercurial, hooks are not revision controlled, and do not propagate when you clone, or pull from, a repository. The reason for
this is simple: a hook is a completely arbitrary piece of executable code. It runs under your user identity, with your privilege
level, on your machine.
</p><!--l. 97--><p class="indent">   It would be extremely reckless for any distributed revision control system to implement revision-controlled
hooks, as this would offer an easily exploitable way to subvert the accounts of users of the revision control
system.
</p><!--l. 102--><p class="indent">   Since Mercurial does not propagate hooks, if you are collaborating with other people on a common project, you should not
assume that they are using the same Mercurial hooks as you are, or that theirs are correctly configured. You should document
the hooks you expect people to use.
</p><!--l. 108--><p class="indent">   In a corporate intranet, this is somewhat easier to control, as you can for example provide a &#x201C;standard&#x201D; installation of
Mercurial on an NFS filesystem, and use a site-wide <a 
 id="dx14-201001"></a><a 
 id="dx14-201002"></a><span 
class="pcrr7tn-">hgrc</span>&#x00A0;file to define hooks that all users will see. However, this too has its
limits; see below.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">10.2.3    </span> <a 
 id="x14-20200010.2.3"></a>Hooks can be overridden</h4>
<!--l. 115--><p class="noindent">Mercurial allows you to override a hook definition by redefining the hook. You can disable it by setting its value to the empty
string, or change its behaviour as you wish.
</p><!--l. 119--><p class="indent">   If you deploy a system-&#x00A0;or site-wide <a 
 id="dx14-202001"></a><a 
 id="dx14-202002"></a><span 
class="pcrr7tn-">hgrc</span>&#x00A0;file that defines some hooks, you should thus understand that your users can
disable or override those hooks.

</p>
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">10.2.4    </span> <a 
 id="x14-20300010.2.4"></a>Ensuring that critical hooks are run</h4>
<!--l. 125--><p class="noindent">Sometimes you may want to enforce a policy that you do not want others to be able to work around. For example, you may
have a requirement that every changeset must pass a rigorous set of tests. Defining this requirement via a hook in a site-wide
<a 
 id="dx14-203001"></a><a 
 id="dx14-203002"></a><span 
class="pcrr7tn-">hgrc</span>&#x00A0;won&#x2019;t work for remote users on laptops, and of course local users can subvert it at will by overriding the
hook.
</p><!--l. 132--><p class="indent">   Instead, you can set up your policies for use of Mercurial so that people are expected to propagate changes through a
well-known &#x201C;canonical&#x201D; server that you have locked down and configured appropriately.
</p><!--l. 137--><p class="indent">   One way to do this is via a combination of social engineering and technology. Set up a restricted-access account; users can
push changes over the network to repositories managed by this account, but they cannot log into the account and run
normal shell commands. In this scenario, a user can commit a changeset that contains any old garbage they
want.
</p><!--l. 144--><p class="indent">   When someone pushes a changeset to the server that everyone pulls from, the server will test the changeset before it accepts
it as permanent, and reject it if it fails to pass the test suite. If people only pull changes from this filtering server, it will serve to
ensure that all changes that people pull have been automatically vetted.

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">10.3    </span> <a 
 id="x14-20400010.3"></a>Care with <span 
class="pcrr7tn-">pretxn </span>hooks in a shared-access repository</h3>
<!--l. 153--><p class="noindent">If you want to use hooks to do some automated work in a repository that a number of people have shared access to, you need to
be careful in how you do this.
</p><!--l. 157--><p class="indent">   Mercurial only locks a repository when it is writing to the repository, and only the parts of Mercurial that write to the
repository pay attention to locks. Write locks are necessary to prevent multiple simultaneous writers from scribbling on each
other&#x2019;s work, corrupting the repository.
</p><!--l. 163--><p class="indent">   Because Mercurial is careful with the order in which it reads and writes data, it does not need to acquire a lock when it
wants to read data from the repository. The parts of Mercurial that read from the repository never pay attention to locks. This
lockless reading scheme greatly increases performance and concurrency.
</p><!--l. 169--><p class="indent">   With great performance comes a trade-off, though, one which has the potential to cause you trouble unless you&#x2019;re aware of
it. To describe this requires a little detail about how Mercurial adds changesets to a repository and reads those
changes.
</p><!--l. 174--><p class="indent">   When Mercurial <span 
class="ptmri7t-">writes </span>metadata, it writes it straight into the destination file. It writes file data first, then manifest data
(which contains pointers to the new file data), then changelog data (which contains pointers to the new manifest data).
Before the first write to each file, it stores a record of where the end of the file was in its transaction log. If the
transaction must be rolled back, Mercurial simply truncates each file back to the size it was before the transaction
began.
</p><!--l. 183--><p class="indent">   When Mercurial <span 
class="ptmri7t-">reads </span>metadata, it reads the changelog first, then everything else. Since a reader will only
access parts of the manifest or file metadata that it can see in the changelog, it can never see partially written
data.
</p><!--l. 188--><p class="indent">   Some controlling hooks (<a 
 id="dx14-204001"></a><a 
 id="dx14-204002"></a><span 
class="pcrr7tn-">pretxncommit </span>and <a 
 id="dx14-204003"></a><a 
 id="dx14-204004"></a><span 
class="pcrr7tn-">pretxnchangegroup</span>) run when a transaction is almost complete. All of the
metadata has been written, but Mercurial can still roll the transaction back and cause the newly-written data to
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
disappear.
</p><!--l. 193--><p class="indent">   If one of these hooks runs for long, it opens a window of time during which a reader can see the metadata for changesets
that are not yet permanent, and should not be thought of as &#x201C;really there&#x201D;. The longer the hook runs, the longer that window is
open.

</p>
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">10.3.1    </span> <a 
 id="x14-20500010.3.1"></a>The problem illustrated</h4>
<!--l. 200--><p class="noindent">In principle, a good use for the <a 
 id="dx14-205001"></a><a 
 id="dx14-205002"></a><span 
class="pcrr7tn-">pretxnchangegroup </span>hook would be to automatically build and test incoming
changes before they are accepted into a central repository. This could let you guarantee that nobody can push
changes to this repository that &#x201C;break the build&#x201D;. But if a client can pull changes while they&#x2019;re being tested, the
usefulness of the test is zero; an unsuspecting someone can pull untested changes, potentially breaking their
build.
</p><!--l. 208--><p class="indent">   The safest technological answer to this challenge is to set up such a &#x201C;gatekeeper&#x201D; repository as <span 
class="ptmri7t-">unidirectional</span>. Let it take
changes pushed in from the outside, but do not allow anyone to pull changes from it (use the <a 
 id="dx14-205003"></a><a 
 id="dx14-205004"></a><span 
class="pcrr7tn-">preoutgoing </span>hook to lock it
down). Configure a <a 
 id="dx14-205005"></a><a 
 id="dx14-205006"></a><span 
class="pcrr7tn-">changegroup </span>hook so that if a build or test succeeds, the hook will push the new changes out to another
repository that people <span 
class="ptmri7t-">can </span>pull from.
</p><!--l. 216--><p class="indent">   In practice, putting a centralised bottleneck like this in place is not often a good idea, and transaction visibility has nothing
to do with the problem. As the size of a project&#x2014;and the time it takes to build and test&#x2014;grows, you rapidly run into a wall with
this &#x201C;try before you buy&#x201D; approach, where you have more changesets to test than time in which to deal with them. The
inevitable result is frustration on the part of all involved.
</p><!--l. 224--><p class="indent">   An approach that scales better is to get people to build and test before they push, then run automated builds and tests
centrally <span 
class="ptmri7t-">after </span>a push, to be sure all is well. The advantage of this approach is that it does not impose a limit on the rate at which
the repository can accept changes.

<!--l. 267--><p class="indent">   To give a well-defined order of execution when there are multiple hooks defined for an event, Mercurial sorts hooks by
extension, and executes the hook commands in this sorted order. In the above example, it will execute <span 
class="pcrr7tn-">commit.bar </span>before
<span 
class="pcrr7tn-">commit.foo</span>, and <span 
class="pcrr7tn-">commit </span>before both.
</p><!--l. 273--><p class="indent">   It is a good idea to use a somewhat descriptive extension when you define a new hook. This will help you to remember what
the hook was for. If the hook fails, you&#x2019;ll get an error message that contains the hook name and extension, so using a
descriptive extension could give you an immediate hint as to why the hook failed (see section&#x00A0;<a

 id="x14-20900010.5"></a>Writing your own hooks</h3>
<!--l. 318--><p class="noindent">When you are writing a hook, you might find it useful to run Mercurial either with the <a 
 id="dx14-209001"></a><span 
class="pcrr7tn-">-v </span>option, or the <a 
 id="dx14-209002"></a><span 
class="pcrr7tn-">verbose </span>config item set
to &#x201C;true&#x201D;. When you do so, Mercurial will print a message before it calls each hook.
</p><!--l. 323--><p class="noindent">
</p>
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">10.5.1    </span> <a 
 id="x14-21000010.5.1"></a>Choosing how your hook should run</h4>
<!--l. 326--><p class="noindent">You can write a hook either as a normal program&#x2014;typically a shell script&#x2014;or as a Python function that is executed within the
Mercurial process.
</p><!--l. 330--><p class="indent">   Writing a hook as an external program has the advantage that it requires no knowledge of Mercurial&#x2019;s internals. You can
call normal Mercurial commands to get any added information you need. The trade-off is that external hooks are slower than
in-process hooks.
</p><!--l. 335--><p class="indent">   An in-process Python hook has complete access to the Mercurial API, and does not &#x201C;shell out&#x201D; to another process, so it is
inherently faster than an external hook. It is also easier to obtain much of the information that a hook requires by using the
Mercurial API than by running Mercurial commands.
</p><!--l. 341--><p class="indent">   If you are comfortable with Python, or require high performance, writing your hooks in Python may be a good choice.
However, when you have a straightforward hook to write and you don&#x2019;t need to care about performance (probably the majority
of hooks), a shell script is perfectly fine.
</p><!--l. 347--><p class="noindent">
</p>
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">10.5.2    </span> <a 
 id="x14-21100010.5.2"></a>Hook parameters</h4>
<!--l. 350--><p class="noindent">Mercurial calls each hook with a set of well-defined parameters. In Python, a parameter is passed as a keyword argument to
your hook function. For an external program, a parameter is passed as an environment variable.
</p><!--l. 355--><p class="indent">   Whether your hook is written in Python or as a shell script, the hook-specific parameter names and values will be the same.
A boolean parameter will be represented as a boolean value in Python, but as the number 1 (for &#x201C;true&#x201D;) or 0 (for
&#x201C;false&#x201D;) as an environment variable for an external hook. If a hook parameter is named <span 
class="pcrr7tn-">foo</span>, the keyword argument
for a Python hook will also be named <span 
class="pcrr7tn-">foo</span>, while the environment variable for an external hook will be named
<span 
class="pcrr7tn-">HG</span><span 
class="pcrr7tn-">_FOO</span>.

<!--l. 366--><p class="noindent">A hook that executes successfully must exit with a status of zero if external, or return boolean &#x201C;false&#x201D; if in-process. Failure is
indicated with a non-zero exit status from an external hook, or an in-process hook returning boolean &#x201C;true&#x201D;. If an in-process
hook raises an exception, the hook is considered to have failed.
</p><!--l. 372--><p class="indent">   For a hook that controls whether an activity can proceed, zero/false means &#x201C;allow&#x201D;, while non-zero/true/exception means
&#x201C;deny&#x201D;.

 id="dx14-213001"></a><a 
 id="dx14-213002"></a><span 
class="pcrr7tn-">hgrc</span>&#x00A0;and the hook is run, its value is passed to your shell, which interprets it. This
means that you can use normal shell constructs in the body of the hook.
</p><!--l. 381--><p class="indent">   An executable hook is always run with its current directory set to a repository&#x2019;s root directory.
</p><!--l. 384--><p class="indent">   Each hook parameter is passed in as an environment variable; the name is upper-cased, and prefixed with the string
&#x201C;<span 
class="pcrr7tn-">HG</span><span 
class="pcrr7tn-">_</span>&#x201D;.
</p><!--l. 387--><p class="indent">   With the exception of hook parameters, Mercurial does not set or modify any environment variables when running a hook.
This is useful to remember if you are writing a site-wide hook that may be run by a number of different users with differing
environment variables set. In multi-user situations, you should not rely on environment variables being set to the values you
have in your environment when testing the hook.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">10.6.2    </span> <a 
 id="x14-21800010.6.2"></a>Checking for trailing whitespace</h4>
<!--l. 450--><p class="noindent">An interesting use of a commit-related hook is to help you to write cleaner code. A simple example of &#x201C;cleaner code&#x201D; is the
dictum that a change should not add any new lines of text that contain &#x201C;trailing whitespace&#x201D;. Trailing whitespace is a series of
space and tab characters at the end of a line of text. In most cases, trailing whitespace is unnecessary, invisible noise, but it is
occasionally problematic, and people often prefer to get rid of it.
</p><!--l. 458--><p class="indent">   You can use either the <a 
 id="dx14-218001"></a><a 
 id="dx14-218002"></a><span 
class="pcrr7tn-">precommit </span>or <a 
 id="dx14-218003"></a><a 
 id="dx14-218004"></a><span 
class="pcrr7tn-">pretxncommit </span>hook to tell whether you have a trailing whitespace problem. If you
use the <a 
 id="dx14-218005"></a><a 
 id="dx14-218006"></a><span 
class="pcrr7tn-">precommit </span>hook, the hook will not know which files you are committing, so it will have to check every modified file in
the repository for trailing white space. If you want to commit a change to just the file <span 
class="pcrr7tn-">foo</span>, but the file <span 
class="pcrr7tn-">bar </span>contains trailing
whitespace, doing a check in the <a 
 id="dx14-218007"></a><a 
 id="dx14-218008"></a><span 
class="pcrr7tn-">precommit </span>hook will prevent you from committing <span 
class="pcrr7tn-">foo </span>due to the problem with <span 
class="pcrr7tn-">bar</span>. This
doesn&#x2019;t seem right.
</p><!--l. 468--><p class="indent">   Should you choose the <a 
 id="dx14-218009"></a><a 
 id="dx14-218010"></a><span 
class="pcrr7tn-">pretxncommit </span>hook, the check won&#x2019;t occur until just before the transaction for the commit
completes. This will allow you to check for problems only the exact files that are being committed. However, if you entered the
commit message interactively and the hook fails, the transaction will roll back; you&#x2019;ll have to re-enter the commit message after
you fix the trailing whitespace and run <a

but not very helpful. It exits with an error status if a change adds a line with trailing whitespace to any file,
but does not print any information that might help us to identify the offending file or line. It also has the nice
property of not paying attention to unmodified lines; only lines that introduce new trailing whitespace cause
problems.

trailing whitespace, and prints the name of the file and the line number of each such occurrence. Even better, if the change adds
trailing whitespace, this hook saves the commit comment and prints the name of the save file before exiting and telling
