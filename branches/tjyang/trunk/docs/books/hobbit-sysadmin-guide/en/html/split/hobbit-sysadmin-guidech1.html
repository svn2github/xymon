 id="x5-80001.1"></a>About revision control</h3>
<!--l. 6--><p class="noindent">Revision control is the process of managing multiple versions of a piece of information. In its simplest form, this is something
that many people do by hand: every time you modify a file, save it under a new name that contains a number, each one higher
than the number of the preceding version.
</p><!--l. 12--><p class="indent">   Manually managing multiple versions of even a single file is an error-prone task, though, so software tools to help automate
this process have long been available. The earliest automated revision control tools were intended to help a single user to
manage revisions of a single file. Over the past few decades, the scope of revision control tools has expanded greatly; they now
manage multiple files, and help multiple people to work together. The best modern revision control tools have no
problem coping with thousands of people working together on projects that consist of hundreds of thousands of
files.
</p><!--l. 22--><p class="noindent">
</p>
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1.1    </span> <a 
 id="x5-90001.1.1"></a>Why use revision control?</h4>
<!--l. 24--><p class="noindent">There are a number of reasons why you or your team might want to use an automated revision control tool for a project.
</p>
     <ul><li><span class="dt">
     </span><span class="dd">It will track the history and evolution of your project, so you don&#x2019;t have to. For every change, you&#x2019;ll have a log
     of <span 
class="ptmri7t-">who </span>made it; <span 
class="ptmri7t-">why </span>they made it; <span 
class="ptmri7t-">when </span>they made it; and <span 
class="ptmri7t-">what </span>the change was.
     </span><li><span class="dt">
     </span><span class="dd">When you&#x2019;re working with other people, revision control software makes it easier for you to collaborate. For
     example, when people more or less simultaneously make potentially incompatible changes, the software will
     help you to identify and resolve those conflicts.
     </span><li><span class="dt">
     </span><span class="dd">It can help you to recover from mistakes. If you make a change that later turns out to be in error, you can revert to
     an earlier version of one or more files. In fact, a <span 
class="ptmri7t-">really </span>good revision control tool will even help you to efficiently
     figure out exactly when a problem was introduced (see section&#x00A0;<a 
href="hobbit-sysadmin-guidech9.html#x13-1880009.5">9.5<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:undo:bisect --></a> for details).
     </span><li><span class="dt">
     </span><span class="dd">It will help you to work simultaneously on, and manage the drift between, multiple versions of your project.</li></ul>
<!--l. 44--><p class="noindent">Most of these reasons are equally valid&#x2014;at least in theory&#x2014;whether you&#x2019;re working on a project by yourself, or with a hundred
other people.
</p><!--l. 48--><p class="indent">   A key question about the practicality of revision control at these two different scales (&#x201C;lone hacker&#x201D; and &#x201C;huge team&#x201D;) is
how its <span 
class="ptmri7t-">benefits </span>compare to its <span 
class="ptmri7t-">costs</span>. A revision control tool that&#x2019;s difficult to understand or use is going to impose a high
cost.
</p><!--l. 53--><p class="indent">   A five-hundred-person project is likely to collapse under its own weight almost immediately without a revision control tool
and process. In this case, the cost of using revision control might hardly seem worth considering, since <span 
class="ptmri7t-">without </span>it, failure is
almost guaranteed.
</p><!--l. 59--><p class="indent">   On the other hand, a one-person &#x201C;quick hack&#x201D; might seem like a poor place to use a revision control tool, because surely the
cost of using one must be close to the overall cost of the project. Right?
</p><!--l. 63--><p class="indent">   Mercurial uniquely supports <span 
class="ptmri7t-">both </span>of these scales of development. You can learn the basics in just a few minutes, and due to
its low overhead, you can apply revision control to the smallest of projects with ease. Its simplicity means you won&#x2019;t have a lot
of abstruse concepts or command sequences competing for mental space with whatever you&#x2019;re <span 
class="ptmri7t-">really </span>trying to do. At
the same time, Mercurial&#x2019;s high performance and peer-to-peer nature let you scale painlessly to handle large
projects.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
</p><!--l. 72--><p class="indent">   No revision control tool can rescue a poorly run project, but a good choice of tools can make a huge difference to the
fluidity with which you can work on a project.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1.2    </span> <a 
 id="x5-100001.1.2"></a>The many names of revision control</h4>
<!--l. 78--><p class="noindent">Revision control is a diverse field, so much so that it doesn&#x2019;t actually have a single name or acronym. Here are a few of the
more common names and acronyms you&#x2019;ll encounter: </p>
     <ul><li><span class="dt">
     </span><span class="dd">Revision control (RCS)
     </span><li><span class="dt">
     </span><span class="dd">Software configuration management (SCM), or configuration management
     </span><li><span class="dt">
     </span><span class="dd">Source code management
     </span><li><span class="dt">
     </span><span class="dd">Source code control, or source control
     </span><li><span class="dt">
     </span><span class="dd">Version control (VCS)</li></ul>
<!--l. 88--><p class="noindent">Some people claim that these terms actually have different meanings, but in practice they overlap so much that there&#x2019;s no agreed or
even useful way to tease them apart.
</p><!--l. 92--><p class="noindent">
</p>
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.2    </span> <a 
 id="x5-110001.2"></a>A short history of revision control</h3>
<!--l. 94--><p class="noindent">The best known of the old-time revision control tools is SCCS (Source Code Control System), which Marc Rochkind wrote at
Bell Labs, in the early 1970s. SCCS operated on individual files, and required every person working on a project to have access
to a shared workspace on a single system. Only one person could modify a file at any time; arbitration for access to files was via
locks. It was common for people to lock files, and later forget to unlock them, preventing anyone else from modifying those
files without the help of an administrator.
</p><!--l. 104--><p class="indent">   Walter Tichy developed a free alternative to SCCS in the early 1980s; he called his program RCS (Revison Control
System). Like SCCS, RCS required developers to work in a single shared workspace, and to lock files to prevent multiple
people from modifying them simultaneously.
</p><!--l. 109--><p class="indent">   Later in the 1980s, Dick Grune used RCS as a building block for a set of shell scripts he initially called cmt, but then
renamed to CVS (Concurrent Versions System). The big innovation of CVS was that it let developers work simultaneously and
somewhat independently in their own personal workspaces. The personal workspaces prevented developers from stepping on
each other&#x2019;s toes all the time, as was common with SCCS and RCS. Each developer had a copy of every project file, and could
modify their copies independently. They had to merge their edits prior to committing changes to the central
repository.
</p><!--l. 119--><p class="indent">   Brian Berliner took Grune&#x2019;s original scripts and rewrote them in&#x00A0;C, releasing in 1989 the code that has since developed into
the modern version of CVS. CVS subsequently acquired the ability to operate over a network connection, giving it a
client/server architecture. CVS&#x2019;s architecture is centralised; only the server has a copy of the history of the project. Client
workspaces just contain copies of recent versions of the project&#x2019;s files, and a little metadata to tell them where the
server is. CVS has been enormously successful; it is probably the world&#x2019;s most widely used revision control
system.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
</p><!--l. 129--><p class="indent">   In the early 1990s, Sun Microsystems developed an early distributed revision control system, called TeamWare. A
TeamWare workspace contains a complete copy of the project&#x2019;s history. TeamWare has no notion of a central repository. (CVS
relied upon RCS for its history storage; TeamWare used SCCS.)
</p><!--l. 135--><p class="indent">   As the 1990s progressed, awareness grew of a number of problems with CVS. It records simultaneous changes to multiple
files individually, instead of grouping them together as a single logically atomic operation. It does not manage
its file hierarchy well; it is easy to make a mess of a repository by renaming files and directories. Worse, its
source code is difficult to read and maintain, which made the &#x201C;pain level&#x201D; of fixing these architectural problems
prohibitive.
</p><!--l. 143--><p class="indent">   In 2001, Jim Blandy and Karl Fogel, two developers who had worked on CVS, started a project to replace it with a tool that
would have a better architecture and cleaner code. The result, Subversion, does not stray from CVS&#x2019;s centralised
client/server model, but it adds multi-file atomic commits, better namespace management, and a number of
other features that make it a generally better tool than CVS. Since its initial release, it has rapidly grown in
popularity.
</p><!--l. 151--><p class="indent">   More or less simultaneously, Graydon Hoare began working on an ambitious distributed revision control system that he
named Monotone. While Monotone addresses many of CVS&#x2019;s design flaws and has a peer-to-peer architecture, it goes beyond
earlier (and subsequent) revision control tools in a number of innovative ways. It uses cryptographic hashes as identifiers, and
has an integral notion of &#x201C;trust&#x201D; for code from different sources.
</p><!--l. 159--><p class="indent">   Mercurial began life in 2005. While a few aspects of its design are influenced by Monotone, Mercurial focuses on ease of
use, high performance, and scalability to very large projects.

</p>
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.3    </span> <a 
 id="x5-120001.3"></a>Trends in revision control</h3>
<!--l. 165--><p class="noindent">There has been an unmistakable trend in the development and use of revision control tools over the past four decades, as people
have become familiar with the capabilities of their tools and constrained by their limitations.
</p><!--l. 170--><p class="indent">   The first generation began by managing single files on individual computers. Although these tools represented a huge
advance over ad-hoc manual revision control, their locking model and reliance on a single computer limited them to small,
tightly-knit teams.
</p><!--l. 175--><p class="indent">   The second generation loosened these constraints by moving to network-centered architectures, and managing entire
projects at a time. As projects grew larger, they ran into new problems. With clients needing to talk to servers very frequently,
server scaling became an issue for large projects. An unreliable network connection could prevent remote users from being able
to talk to the server at all. As open source projects started making read-only access available anonymously to anyone, people
without commit privileges found that they could not use the tools to interact with a project in a natural way, as they could not
record their changes.
</p><!--l. 186--><p class="indent">   The current generation of revision control tools is peer-to-peer in nature. All of these systems have dropped the dependency
on a single central server, and allow people to distribute their revision control data to where it&#x2019;s actually needed. Collaboration
over the Internet has moved from constrained by technology to a matter of choice and consensus. Modern tools can operate
offline indefinitely and autonomously, with a network connection only needed when syncing changes with another
repository.
</p><!--l. 195--><p class="noindent">
</p>
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.4    </span> <a 
 id="x5-130001.4"></a>A few of the advantages of distributed revision control</h3>
<!--l. 197--><p class="noindent">Even though distributed revision control tools have for several years been as robust and usable as their previous-generation
counterparts, people using older tools have not yet necessarily woken up to their advantages. There are a number of ways in
which distributed tools shine relative to centralised ones.
</p><!--l. 203--><p class="indent">   For an individual developer, distributed tools are almost always much faster than centralised tools. This is for a simple
reason: a centralised tool needs to talk over the network for many common operations, because most metadata is stored in a
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
single copy on the central server. A distributed tool stores all of its metadata locally. All else being equal, talking over the
network adds overhead to a centralised tool. Don&#x2019;t underestimate the value of a snappy, responsive tool: you&#x2019;re going to spend a
lot of time interacting with your revision control software.
</p><!--l. 213--><p class="indent">   Distributed tools are indifferent to the vagaries of your server infrastructure, again because they replicate metadata to so
many locations. If you use a centralised system and your server catches fire, you&#x2019;d better hope that your backup media are
reliable, and that your last backup was recent and actually worked. With a distributed tool, you have many backups available on
every contributor&#x2019;s computer.
</p><!--l. 220--><p class="indent">   The reliability of your network will affect distributed tools far less than it will centralised tools. You can&#x2019;t even use a
centralised tool without a network connection, except for a few highly constrained commands. With a distributed tool, if your
network connection goes down while you&#x2019;re working, you may not even notice. The only thing you won&#x2019;t be able to do is talk
to repositories on other computers, something that is relatively rare compared with local operations. If you have a far-flung
team of collaborators, this may be significant.
</p><!--l. 229--><p class="noindent">
</p>
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.4.1    </span> <a 
 id="x5-140001.4.1"></a>Advantages for open source projects</h4>
<!--l. 231--><p class="noindent">If you take a shine to an open source project and decide that you would like to start hacking on it, and that project uses a
distributed revision control tool, you are at once a peer with the people who consider themselves the &#x201C;core&#x201D; of that project. If
they publish their repositories, you can immediately copy their project history, start making changes, and record your work,
using the same tools in the same ways as insiders. By contrast, with a centralised tool, you must use the software in a &#x201C;read
only&#x201D; mode unless someone grants you permission to commit changes to their central server. Until then, you won&#x2019;t be able to
record changes, and your local modifications will be at risk of corruption any time you try to update your client&#x2019;s view of the
repository.
</p><!--l. 244--><p class="noindent">
</p>
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x5-150001.4.1"></a>The forking non-problem</h5>
<!--l. 246--><p class="noindent">It has been suggested that distributed revision control tools pose some sort of risk to open source projects because they make it
easy to &#x201C;fork&#x201D; the development of a project. A fork happens when there are differences in opinion or attitude between groups of
developers that cause them to decide that they can&#x2019;t work together any longer. Each side takes a more or less complete copy of
the project&#x2019;s source code, and goes off in its own direction.
</p><!--l. 254--><p class="indent">   Sometimes the camps in a fork decide to reconcile their differences. With a centralised revision control system, the
<span 
class="ptmri7t-">technical </span>process of reconciliation is painful, and has to be performed largely by hand. You have to decide whose revision
history is going to &#x201C;win&#x201D;, and graft the other team&#x2019;s changes into the tree somehow. This usually loses some or all of one side&#x2019;s
revision history.
</p><!--l. 261--><p class="indent">   What distributed tools do with respect to forking is they make forking the <span 
class="ptmri7t-">only </span>way to develop a project. Every single
change that you make is potentially a fork point. The great strength of this approach is that a distributed revision
control tool has to be really good at <span 
class="ptmri7t-">merging </span>forks, because forks are absolutely fundamental: they happen all the
time.
</p><!--l. 268--><p class="indent">   If every piece of work that everybody does, all the time, is framed in terms of forking and merging, then what the open
source world refers to as a &#x201C;fork&#x201D; becomes <span 
class="ptmri7t-">purely </span>a social issue. If anything, distributed tools <span 
class="ptmri7t-">lower </span>the likelihood of a fork:
</p>
     <ul><li><span class="dt">
     </span><span class="dd">They eliminate the social distinction that centralised tools impose: that between insiders (people with commit
     access) and outsiders (people without).
     </span><li><span class="dt">
     </span><span class="dd">They make it easier to reconcile after a social fork, because all that&#x2019;s involved from the perspective of the revision
     control software is just another merge.</li></ul>
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<!--l. 281--><p class="indent">   Some people resist distributed tools because they want to retain tight control over their projects, and they believe
that centralised tools give them this control. However, if you&#x2019;re of this belief, and you publish your CVS or
Subversion repositories publically, there are plenty of tools available that can pull out your entire project&#x2019;s history
(albeit slowly) and recreate it somewhere that you don&#x2019;t control. So while your control in this case is illusory,
you are forgoing the ability to fluidly collaborate with whatever people feel compelled to mirror and fork your
history.
</p><!--l. 291--><p class="noindent">
</p>
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.4.2    </span> <a 
 id="x5-160001.4.2"></a>Advantages for commercial projects</h4>
<!--l. 293--><p class="noindent">Many commercial projects are undertaken by teams that are scattered across the globe. Contributors who are far from a central
server will see slower command execution and perhaps less reliability. Commercial revision control systems attempt to
ameliorate these problems with remote-site replication add-ons that are typically expensive to buy and cantankerous to
administer. A distributed system doesn&#x2019;t suffer from these problems in the first place. Better yet, you can easily set up multiple
authoritative servers, say one per site, so that there&#x2019;s no redundant communication between repositories over expensive
long-haul network links.
</p><!--l. 304--><p class="indent">   Centralised revision control systems tend to have relatively low scalability. It&#x2019;s not unusual for an expensive centralised
system to fall over under the combined load of just a few dozen concurrent users. Once again, the typical response
tends to be an expensive and clunky replication facility. Since the load on a central server&#x2014;if you have one at
all&#x2014;is many times lower with a distributed tool (because all of the data is replicated everywhere), a single cheap
server can handle the needs of a much larger team, and replication to balance load becomes a simple matter of
scripting.
</p><!--l. 314--><p class="indent">   If you have an employee in the field, troubleshooting a problem at a customer&#x2019;s site, they&#x2019;ll benefit from distributed revision
control. The tool will let them generate custom builds, try different fixes in isolation from each other, and search efficiently
through history for the sources of bugs and regressions in the customer&#x2019;s environment, all without needing to connect to your
company&#x2019;s network.

<!--l. 332--><p class="indent">   If you are at all familiar with revision control systems, you should be able to get up and running with Mercurial in
less than five minutes. Even if not, it will take no more than a few minutes longer. Mercurial&#x2019;s command and
feature sets are generally uniform and consistent, so you can keep track of a few general rules instead of a host of
exceptions.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
</p><!--l. 339--><p class="indent">   On a small project, you can start working with Mercurial in moments. Creating new changes and branches; transferring
changes around (whether locally or over a network); and history and status operations are all fast. Mercurial
attempts to stay nimble and largely out of your way by combining low cognitive overhead with blazingly fast
operations.
</p><!--l. 346--><p class="indent">   The usefulness of Mercurial is not limited to small projects: it is used by projects with hundreds to thousands of
contributors, each containing tens of thousands of files and hundreds of megabytes of source code.
</p><!--l. 351--><p class="indent">   If the core functionality of Mercurial is not enough for you, it&#x2019;s easy to build on. Mercurial is well suited to scripting tasks,
and its clean internals and implementation in Python make it easy to add features in the form of extensions. There are a
number of popular and useful extensions already available, ranging from helping to identify bugs to improving
performance.

<!--l. 368--><p class="noindent">Subversion is a popular revision control tool, developed to replace CVS. It has a centralised client/server architecture.
</p><!--l. 371--><p class="indent">   Subversion and Mercurial have similarly named commands for performing the same operations, so if you&#x2019;re familiar with
one, it is easy to learn to use the other. Both tools are portable to all popular operating systems.
</p><!--l. 376--><p class="indent">   Subversion lacks a history-aware merge capability, forcing its users to manually track exactly which revisions have been
merged between branches. If users fail to do this, or make mistakes, they face the prospect of manually resolving merges with
unnecessary conflicts. Subversion also fails to merge changes when files or directories are renamed. Subversion&#x2019;s poor merge
support is its single biggest weakness.
</p><!--l. 384--><p class="indent">   Mercurial has a substantial performance advantage over Subversion on every revision control operation I have
benchmarked. I have measured its advantage as ranging from a factor of two to a factor of six when compared with
Subversion&#x00A0;1.4.3&#x2019;s <span 
class="ptmri7t-">ra</span><span 
class="ptmri7t-">_local </span>file store, which is the fastest access method available). In more realistic deployments involving a
network-based store, Subversion will be at a substantially larger disadvantage. Because many Subversion commands must talk
to the server and Subversion does not have useful replication facilities, server capacity and network bandwidth become
bottlenecks for modestly large projects.
</p><!--l. 395--><p class="indent">   Additionally, Subversion incurs substantial storage overhead to avoid network transactions for a few common operations,
such as finding modified files (<span 
class="pcrr7tn-">status</span>) and displaying modifications against the current revision (<span 
class="pcrr7tn-">diff</span>). As a result, a
Subversion working copy is often the same size as, or larger than, a Mercurial repository and working directory, even though
the Mercurial repository contains a complete history of the project.
</p><!--l. 403--><p class="indent">   Subversion is widely supported by third party tools. Mercurial currently lags considerably in this area. This gap is closing,
however, and indeed some of Mercurial&#x2019;s GUI tools now outshine their Subversion equivalents. Like Mercurial, Subversion has
an excellent user manual.
</p><!--l. 409--><p class="indent">   Because Subversion doesn&#x2019;t store revision history on the client, it is well suited to managing projects that deal with lots of
large, opaque binary files. If you check in fifty revisions to an incompressible 10MB file, Subversion&#x2019;s client-side space usage
stays constant The space used by any distributed SCM will grow rapidly in proportion to the number of revisions, because the
differences between each revision are large.
</p><!--l. 417--><p class="indent">   In addition, it&#x2019;s often difficult or, more usually, impossible to merge different versions of a binary file. Subversion&#x2019;s ability
to let a user lock a file, so that they temporarily have the exclusive right to commit changes to it, can be a significant advantage
to a project where binary files are widely used.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
</p><!--l. 423--><p class="indent">   Mercurial can import revision history from a Subversion repository. It can also export revision history to a Subversion
repository. This makes it easy to &#x201C;test the waters&#x201D; and use Mercurial and Subversion in parallel before deciding to switch.
History conversion is incremental, so you can perform an initial conversion, then small additional conversions afterwards to
bring in new changes.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.6.2    </span> <a 
 id="x5-200001.6.2"></a>Git</h4>
<!--l. 433--><p class="noindent">Git is a distributed revision control tool that was developed for managing the Linux kernel source tree. Like Mercurial, its early
design was somewhat influenced by Monotone.
</p><!--l. 437--><p class="indent">   Git has a very large command set, with version&#x00A0;1.5.0 providing&#x00A0;139 individual commands. It has something of a reputation
for being difficult to learn. Compared to Git, Mercurial has a strong focus on simplicity.
</p><!--l. 442--><p class="indent">   In terms of performance, Git is extremely fast. In several cases, it is faster than Mercurial, at least on Linux, while
Mercurial performs better on other operations. However, on Windows, the performance and general level of support that Git
provides is, at the time of writing, far behind that of Mercurial.
</p><!--l. 448--><p class="indent">   While a Mercurial repository needs no maintenance, a Git repository requires frequent manual &#x201C;repacks&#x201D; of its
metadata. Without these, performance degrades, while space usage grows rapidly. A server that contains many Git
repositories that are not rigorously and frequently repacked will become heavily disk-bound during backups, and
there have been instances of daily backups taking far longer than&#x00A0;24 hours as a result. A freshly packed Git
repository is slightly smaller than a Mercurial repository, but an unpacked repository is several orders of magnitude
larger.
</p><!--l. 458--><p class="indent">   The core of Git is written in C. Many Git commands are implemented as shell or Perl scripts, and the quality of these scripts
varies widely. I have encountered several instances where scripts charged along blindly in the presence of errors that should
have been fatal.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.6.3    </span> <a 
 id="x5-210001.6.3"></a>CVS</h4>
<!--l. 468--><p class="noindent">CVS is probably the most widely used revision control tool in the world. Due to its age and internal untidiness, it has been only
lightly maintained for many years.
</p><!--l. 472--><p class="indent">   It has a centralised client/server architecture. It does not group related file changes into atomic commits, making it easy for
people to &#x201C;break the build&#x201D;: one person can successfully commit part of a change and then be blocked by the need for a merge,
causing other people to see only a portion of the work they intended to do. This also affects how you work with project history.
If you want to see all of the modifications someone made as part of a task, you will need to manually inspect
the descriptions and timestamps of the changes made to each file involved (if you even know what those files
were).
</p><!--l. 482--><p class="indent">   CVS has a muddled notion of tags and branches that I will not attempt to even describe. It does not support renaming of
files or directories well, making it easy to corrupt a repository. It has almost no internal consistency checking capabilities, so it
is usually not even possible to tell whether or how a repository is corrupt. I would not recommend CVS for any project, existing
or new.
</p><!--l. 489--><p class="indent">   Mercurial can import CVS revision history. However, there are a few caveats that apply; these are true of every other
revision control tool&#x2019;s CVS importer, too. Due to CVS&#x2019;s lack of atomic changes and unversioned filesystem hierarchy, it is not
possible to reconstruct CVS history completely accurately; some guesswork is involved, and renames will usually not show up.
Because a lot of advanced CVS administration has to be done by hand and is hence error-prone, it&#x2019;s common for CVS importers
to run into multiple problems with corrupted repositories (completely bogus revision timestamps and files that
have remained locked for over a decade are just two of the less interesting problems I can recall from personal
experience).

 id="x5-220001.6.4"></a>Commercial tools</h4>
<!--l. 506--><p class="noindent">Perforce has a centralised client/server architecture, with no client-side caching of any data. Unlike modern revision
control tools, Perforce requires that a user run a command to inform the server about every file they intend to
edit.
</p><!--l. 511--><p class="indent">   The performance of Perforce is quite good for small teams, but it falls off rapidly as the number of users grows beyond a
few dozen. Modestly large Perforce installations require the deployment of proxies to cope with the load their users
generate.

 id="x5-230001.6.5"></a>Choosing a revision control tool</h4>
<!--l. 519--><p class="noindent">With the exception of CVS, all of the tools listed above have unique strengths that suit them to particular styles of work. There
is no single revision control tool that is best in all situations.
</p><!--l. 523--><p class="indent">   As an example, Subversion is a good choice for working with frequently edited binary files, due to its centralised nature and
support for file locking. If you&#x2019;re averse to the command line, it currently has better GUI support than other free
revision control tools. However, its poor merging is a substantial liability for busy projects with overlapping
development.
</p><!--l. 530--><p class="indent">   I personally find Mercurial&#x2019;s properties of simplicity, performance, and good merge support to be a compelling combination
that has served me well for several years.

<!--l. 537--><p class="noindent">Mercurial is bundled with an extension named <a

class="pcrr7tn-">convert</span>, which can incrementally import revision history from several other
revision control tools. By &#x201C;incremental&#x201D;, I mean that you can convert all of a project&#x2019;s history to date in one go, then rerun the
conversion later to obtain new changes that happened after the initial conversion.
</p><!--l. 543--><p class="indent">   The revision control tools supported by <a
