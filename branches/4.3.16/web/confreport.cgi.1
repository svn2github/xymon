.TH CONFREPORT.CGI 1 "Version 4.3.15: 30 Jan 2014" "Xymon"
.SH NAME
confreport.cgi \- Xymon Configuration report
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "confreport.cgi"

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBconfreport.cgi\fR is invoked as a CGI script via the 
confreport.sh CGI wrapper.

\fBconfreport.cgi\fR provides a plain HTML (Web) report of
the Xymon configuration for a group of hosts; which hosts are included
is determined by the hosts available on the webpage from where the CGI
script is invoked.

The configuration report include the hostnames, a list of the statuses
monitored for each host, and if applicable any configuration settings
affecting these. Alerts that may be triggered by status changes are also
included.

The report is plain HTML without any images included, and therefore suitable
for inclusion into e-mails or other documents that may be accessed outside
the Xymon system.

.IP "--env=FILENAME"
