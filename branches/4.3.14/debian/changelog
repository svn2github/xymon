xymon (4.3.14) unstable; urgency=low

   * rev 7376
   * Fix critical ack not working for hosts where the display-name is
     set (via "NAME:" tag). From Any Smith.
   * SNI (Server Name Indication) causes some SSL connections to fail
     due to server-side buggy SSL implementations. Add "sni" and "nosni" 
     flags to control SNI for specific hosts, and "--sni" option for 
     xymonnet to control the default. Reported by Mark Felder.
   * Fix build process to fully obey any XYMONTOPDIR setting from the
     top-level Makefile. NOTE: Client-only builds no longer install the
     client in a "client/" subdirectory below XYMONHOME.
   * Fix showgraph so it silently ignores stale rrdctl files when trying
     to flush RRD data before showing a graph.
   * Fix xymond_alert crashing when trying to strip <cr> characters
     from the alert message. Bug introduced in 4.3.13.
   * Fix Solaris client to report memory even when no swap is configured.
   * Fix bug where alerts that were initially suppressed due to TIME
     restrictions are delayed until REPEAT interval expires.
   * Fix crash in xymonlaunch when trying to find tasks.cfg
   * Fix HTML generated by acknowledge.cgi (missing '>')
   * Fix Linux client reporting garbled client data if top output ends 
     without a new-line (causes CPU load and other vmstat graphs to
     stop updating)
   * Fix Debian installation so it enables Apache mod_rewrite
   * Fix merge-lines utility crashing when first line was an include
   * Fix "make install" failing when server/www/help was a symlink
   * Document existing OPTIONAL setting in analysis.cfg for file-checks 
     on files which may not exist.
   * Document existing CLASS setting in alerts.cfg
   * Add new INFOCOLUMNGIF and TRENDSCOLUMNGIF settings so the icons 
     used for these pages are configurable.
   * Enhance Solaris client to correctly handle Solaris zones.
   * Add new search facilities to xymond to select hosts with the
     'xymondboard' and 'hostinfo' commands.
   * New --ack-each-color option for xymondd changes ack behaviour so a 
     yellow ack does not apply when status changed to red, but a red ack 
     applies if status goes yellow
   * New "headermatch" tag for http tests so content checks can look at
     HTTP headers in addition to the HTML body.
   * Use system-wide c-ares library. NB: Now requires libc-ares2.

xymon (4.3.3) unstable; urgency=high

  rev 6684
  * SECURITY FIX: Some CGI parameters were used to construct

    configurable. Also allow the header/footer for the Critical Systems 
    view to be configurable.
    Suggestion and preliminary patch from Buchan Milne.
  * xymonnet: Improve error report when HTTP tests get an empty response - 
    'HTTP error 0' sounds weird.
  * report / snapshot CGI's: Fix buffer overrun in the HTML delimiter 
    generated in the "please wait..." message. Also, fix potential buffer 
    overrun in report CGI if invoked with a large value for the "style" 
    parameter. 
    Reported by Rolf Biesbroek.
  * Graph definitions (graphs.cfg): Multi graphs cannot use a regex pattern. 
    Problem report by Brian Majeska
  * Solaris interface statistics: Filter out "mac" and "wrsmd" devices at
    the client side. 
    Update RRD handler to also filter "wrsmd" at the server side, like we 
    already did for "mac" devices. 
    Cf. http://www.xymon.com/archive/2009/06/msg00204.html
  * Documentation: Document the XMH_* fields available in xymondboard commands.
  * Documentation: Document SPLITNCV and "trends" methods of doing 
    custom graphs.
  * RRD definitions: Allow override of --step/-s option for rrdcreate, 
    from template supplied in rrddefinitions.cfg. 
    Suggestion from Brian Majeska.
  * mailack: Remove restriction on how long a subjectline/message body can be.
  * Build procedure: Add notice about running upgrade script before 
    installing the new version.
  * xymond_alert: Document --trace option
  * Alerts: For recovery messages, add information so you can tell 
    whether the recovery was due to the service actually recovering, or 
    if it was merely disabled.
  * xymond_alert: Fix missing element in array of alert status texts used 
    for tracing. 
    Spotted by Dominique Frise.
  * Add support for FreeBSD v8 modified ifstat output
  * Documentation: Update information about the Xymon mailing lists 
    following move to Mailman and new archive URL.

xymon (4.3.0-0.20110120.rc1) unstable; urgency=low

  * 4.3.0 RC1 release - rev 6627

  * hosts.cfg badldap documentation: Document that for LDAP URL's you must use 'badldapurl'. Reported by Simo Hmami.
  * xymond flap detection: Make number of tracked status changes and the flap-check period configurable. Change the defaults to trigger flapping at more than 5 status changes in a 30 minute period.
  * sendmessage: Enhanced error reporting, to help track down communication problems.
  * xymond_client: Fix Windows SVC status handling to avoid coredumps, memory corruption and other nasties. 
    Will now report the real name of the service, instead of the pattern used in the analysis.cfg file.
    NOTE: Slight change to status message format.
  * Client handler: Fix owner/user check parsing. Reported by Ian Marsh http://www.xymon.com/archive/2011/01/msg00133.html (also broken in 4.2.3).
  * xymongen: Fix broken --doc-window option handling. Reported by Tom Schmitt.
  * Xymongen: Fix documentation of the --doc-window/--no-doc-window options.
  * Webpage background: Use a CSS and a new set of gif's to implement a background that works on all displays, regardless of width. Uses a new xymonbody.css stylesheet which can also control some other aspects of the webpage. From Francois Claire.
  * Documentation: The xymon 'rename' command should be used AFTER renaming a host in hosts.cfg, not before. From Tom Georgoulias.
  * Memory status: Add some sanity checks for the memory utilisation reported by clients. Occasionally we get completely bogus data from clients, so only act on them if percentages do not exceed 100.
  * Critical systems view: Add "--tooltips" option so you can save screen space by hiding the host descriptions in a tooltip, like we do on the statically generated pages. Feature request from Chris Morris.
  * Solaris client: Report "swap -l" in addition to "swap -s" for swap usage. Backend prefers output from "swap -l" when determining swap utilisation.
  * Webpage menu: Use the CSS and GIF's by Malcolm Hunter - they are much nicer than the ones from Debian. Distribute both the blue and the grey version, and configure which one to use in xymonserver.cfg.

  * xymond: Make sure we do not perform socket operations on invalid sockets (e.g. those from a scheduled task pseudo-connection)
  * Installation: Remove any existing old commands before creating symlinks
  * xymonproxy: Fix broken compatibility option '--bbdisplay'
  * Fix eventlog summary/count enums so they dont clash with Solaris predefined entities
  * History- and hostdata-modules: Dont save data if there is less than 5% free space on the filesystem. Also, dont save hostdata info more than 5 times per hour.
  * Historical statuslog display: Work-around for crash when status-log is empty
  * fping.sh configure sub-script: Fix syntax error in suggested 'sudoers' configuration, and point to the found fping binary. From Steff Coene.
  * namematch routine: Fix broken matching when doing simple matching against two strings where one was a subset of the other. http://www.xymon.com/archive/2010/11/msg00177.html .  Reported by Elmar Heeb who also provided a patch, although I chose a different solution to this.
  * Xymon net: Fix broken compile when LDAP-checks are disabled. Reported by Roland Soderstrom, fix from Ralph Mitchell.
  * xymon(7) manpage: Drop notice that renaming in 4.3.0 is not complete
  * Installation: Setup links for the commonly used Hobbit binaries (bb, bbcmd, bbdigest, bbhostgrep, bbhostshow)
  * Upgrade script: Setup symlinks for the old names of the standard webpages
  * xymonserver.cfg.DIST: Missing end-quote in compatibility BBSERVERSECURECGIURL setting. From Ralph Mitchell
