.TH ACKINFO.CGI 1 "Version 4.3.20-rc1: 12 May 2015" "Xymon"
.SH NAME
ackinfo.cgi \- Xymon CGI script to acknowledge alerts
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "ackinfo.cgi"

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBackinfo.cgi\fR is invoked as a CGI script via the 
ackinfo.sh CGI wrapper.

ackinfo.cgi is used to acknowledge an alert on the Xymon
"Critical Systems" view, generated by the
.I criticalview.cgi(1)
utility. This allows the staff viewing the Critical Systems view to 
acknowledge alerts with a "Level 1" alert, thereby removing the
alert from the Critical Systems view.

Note that the Level 1 alert generated by the ackinfo.cgi
utility does \fBNOT\fR stop alerts from being sent.

In a future version of Xymon (after Xymon 4.2), this utility
will also be used for acknowledging alerts at other levels.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--level=NUMBER"
Sets the acknowledgment level. This is typically used to force a specific
level of the acknowledgment, e.g. a level 1 acknowledge when called from the
Critical Systems view.

.IP "--validity=TIME"
Sets the validity of the acknowledgment. By default this is taken from the
CGI parameters supplied by the user.

.IP "--sender=STRING"
Logs STRING as the sender of the acknowledgment. By default, this is taken
from the loginname of the webuser sending the acknowledgment.

.IP "--env=FILENAME"
Loads the environment defined in FILENAME before executing the CGI script.

.IP "--area=NAME"
Load environment variables for a specific area. NB: if used,
this option must appear before any --env=FILENAME option.
