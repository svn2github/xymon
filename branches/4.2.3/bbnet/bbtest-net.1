.SH DESCRIPTION
.I bbtest-net(1)
handles the network tests of hosts defined in the Xymon configuration
file, bb-hosts. It is normally run at regular intervals by 
.I hobbitlaunch(8)
via an entry in the
.I hobbitlaunch.cfg(5)
file.

bbtest-net does all of the normal tests of TCP-based network
services (telnet, ftp, ssh, smtp, pop, imap ....) - i.e. 
all of the services listed as BBNETSVCS in bbdef.sh. For
these tests, a completely new and very speedy service-
checker has been implemented.

bbtest-net has built-in support for testing SSL-enabled
protocols, e.g. imaps, pop3s, nntps, telnets, if SSL-support
was enabled when configuring bbgen. The full list of known
tests is found in the
.I bb-services(5)
file in $BBHOME/etc/bb-services.

In addition, it implements the "dns" and "dig" tests for
testing DNS servers. This is done in the same way as 
bb-network.sh does it. 

bbtest-net also implements a check for NTP servers - this test 
is called "ntp". If you want to use it, you must define the
NTPDATE environment variable to point at the location of your
.I ntpdate(1)
program.

Note: bbtest-net performs the connectivity test (ping) based on the
hostname, unless the host is tagged with "testip" or the 
"--dns=ip" option is used. So the target of the connectivity
test can be determined by your /etc/hosts file or DNS.


.SH GENERAL OPTIONS

.IP --timeout=N
Determines the timeout (in seconds) for each
service that is tested. For TCP tests (those from BBNETSVCS),
if the connection to the service does not succeed within N 
seconds, the service is reported as being down. For HTTP
tests, this is the absolute limit for the entire request
to the webserver (the time needed to connect to the server,
plus the time it takes the server to respond to the request).
Default: 10 seconds

.IP --conntimeout=N
This option is deprecated, and will be ignored. Use the
--timeout option instead.

.IP --cmdtimeout=N
This option sets a timeout for the external commands used for
testing of NTP and RPC services, and to perform traceroute.

.IP --concurrency=N 
Determines the number of network tests that
run in parallel. Default is operating system dependent,
but will usually be 256. If bbtest-net begins to complain 
about not being able to get a "socket", try running
bbtest-net with a lower value like 50 or 100.

.IP "--dns-timeout=N (default: 30 seconds)"
bbtest-net will timeout all DNS lookups after N seconds.
Any pending DNS lookups are regarded as failed, i.e. the
network tests that depend on this DNS lookup will report
an error.
.br
Note: If you use the --no-ares option, timeout of DNS
lookups cannot be controlled by bbtest-net.

.IP --dns-max-all=N
Same as "--dns-timeout=N". The "--dns-max-all" option is 
deprecated and should not be used.

.IP --dns=[ip|only|standard]
Determines how bbtest-net finds the IP adresses of the hosts to test. 
By default (the "standard"), bbtest-net does a DNS lookup of the hostname 
to determine the IP address, unless the host has the "testip" 
tag, or the DNS lookup fails.
.br
With "--dns=only" bbtest-net will ONLY do the DNS lookup;
it it fails, then all services on that host will be 
reported as being down.
.br
With "--dns=ip" bbtest-net will never do a DNS lookup;
it will use the IP adresse specified in bb-hosts for
the tests. Thus, this setting is equivalent to having
the "testip" tag on all hosts. Note that http tests
will ignore this setting and still perform a DNS
lookup for the hostname given in the URL; see the
"bbtest-net tags for HTTP tests" section in
.I bb-hosts(5)

.IP --no-ares
Disable the ARES resolver built into bbtest-net. This makes
bbtest-net resolve hostnames using your system resolver
function. You should only use this as a last resort if bbtest-net
cannot resolve the hostnames you use in the normal way (via DNS
or /etc/hosts). One reason for using this would be if you need to 
resolve hostnames via NIS/NIS+ (a.k.a. Yellow Pages).
.br
The system resolver function does not provide a mechanism for
controlling timeouts of the hostname lookups, so if your
DNS or NIS server is down, bbtest-net can take a very long time
to run. The --dns-timeout option is effectively disabled when
using this option.

.IP --dnslog=FILENAME
Log failed hostname lookups to the file FILENAME. FILENAME should 
be a full pathname.

.IP --report[=COLUMNNAME]
With this option, bbtest-net will send a status message with details 
of how many hosts were processed, how many tests were generated, 
any errors that occurred during the run, and some timing statistics. 
The default columnname is "bbtest".

.IP --test-untagged
When using the BBLOCATION environment variable to test
only hosts on a particular network segment, bbtest-net
will ignore hosts that do not have any "NET:x" tag.
So only hosts that have a NET:$BBLOCATION tag will be 
tested.
.br
With this option, hosts with no NET: tag are included
in the test, so that all hosts that either have a
matching NET: tag, or no NET: tag at all are tested.

.IP --frequenttestlimit=N
Used with the
.I bbretest-net.sh(1)
bbgen extension. This option determines how long failed tests
remain in the frequent-test queue. The default is 1800
seconds (30 minutes).

.IP --timelimit=N
Causes bbtest-net to generate a warning if the run-time
of bbtest-net exceeds N seconds. By default N is set to
the value of BBSLEEP, so a warning triggers if the
network tests cannot complete in the time given for one
cycle of the BBNET server. Apart from the warning, this 
option has no effect, i.e. it will not terminate bbtest-net
prematurely. So to eliminate any such warnings, use this
option with a very high value of N.

.IP --huge=N
Warn if the response from a TCP test is more than N bytes.
If you see from the bbtest status report that you are
transferring large amounts of data for your tests, you can
enable this option to see which tests have large replies.
.br
Default: 0 (disabled).

.SH OPTIONS FOR TESTS OF THE SIMPLE TCP SERVICES
.IP --checkresponse[=COLOR]
When testing well-known services (e.g. FTP, SSH, SMTP, POP-2, POP-3, 
IMAP, NNTP and rsync), bbtest-net will look for a valid service-specific
"OK" response. If another reponse is seen, this will cause
the test to report a warning (yellow) status. Without this
option, the response from the service is ignored.
.br
The optional color-name is used to select a color other than
yellow for the status message when the response is wrong.
E.g. "--checkresponse=red" will cause a "red" status message
to be sent when the service does not respond as expected.

.IP --no-flags
By default, bbtest-net sends some extra information in the
status messages, called "flags". These are used by bbgen
e.g. to pick different icons for reversed tests when
generating the Xymon webpages. This option makes
bbtest-net omit these flags from the status messages.


.SH OPTIONS FOR THE PING TEST
Note: bbtest-net uses the program defined by the FPING
environment to execute ping-tests - by default, that is
the
.I hobbitping(1)
utility. See
.I hobbitserver.cfg(5)
for a description of how to customize this, e.g. if you
need to run it with "sudo" or a similar tool.

.IP --ping
Enables bbtest-net's ping test. The column name used for
ping test results is defined by the PINGCOLUMN environment 
variable in 
.I hobbitserver.cfg(5).
.br
If not specifed, bbtest-net uses the CONNTEST environment
variable to determine if it should perform the ping test
or not. So if you prefer to use another tool to implement 
ping checks, either set the CONNTEST environment variable 
to false, or run bbtest-net with the "--noping".

.IP --noping
Disable the connectivity test.

.IP "--trace"
.IP "--notrace"
Enable/disable the use of traceroute when a ping-test fails.
Performing a traceroute for failed ping tests is a slow
operation, so the default is not to do any traceroute, unless
it is requested on a per-host basis via the "trace" tag in the 
.I bb-hosts(5) 
entry for each host. The "--trace" option changes this, so 
the default becomes to run traceroute on all hosts where
the ping test fails; you can then disable it on specific 
hosts by putting a "notrace" tag on the host-entry.


.SH OPTIONS FOR HTTP (WEB) TESTS
.IP --content=CONTENTTESTNAME 
Determines the name of the column Xymon displays for content checks. 
The default is "content".  If you have used the "cont.sh" or "cont2.sh" 
scripts earlier, you may want to use "--content=cont" to report content
checks using the same test name as these scripts do.


.SH OPTIONS FOR SSL CERTIFICATE TESTS
.IP --ssl=SSLCERTTESTNAME
Determines the name of the column Xymon displays for the SSL certificate checks.
The default is "sslcert".
.IP --no-ssl
Disables reporting of the SSL certificate check.

.IP --sslwarn=N
.IP --sslalarm=N
Determines the number of days before an SSL certificate
expires, where bbtest-net will generate a warning or
alarm status for the SSL certificate column.


.SH DEBUGGING OPTIONS
.IP --no-update
Don't send any status updates to the BBDISPLAY server. Instead,
all messages are dumped to stdout.

.IP --timing
Causes bbtest-net to collect information about
the time spent in different parts of the program.
The information is printed on stdout just before
the program ends. Note that this information is also
included in the status report sent with the "--report"
option.

.IP --debug
Dumps a bunch of status about the tests as they
progress to stdout.

.IP --dump[=before|=after|=both]
Dumps internal memory structures before and/or after the
tests have executed.


.SH INFORMATIONAL OPTIONS
.IP "--help or -?"
Provide a summary of available commandline options.

.IP "--version"
Prints the version number of bbtest-net

.IP --services
Dump the list of defined TCP services bbtest-net knows
how to test. Do not run any tests.


.SH USING COOKIES IN WEB TESTS
If the file $BBHOME/etc/cookies exist, cookies will be read from
this file and sent along with the HTTP requests when checking
websites. This file is in the Netscape Cookie format, see
http://www.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html for details
on this format. The
.I curl(1)
utility can output a file in this format if run with the "--cookie-jar FILENAME"
option.


.SH ABOUT SSL CERTIFICATE CHECKS
When bbtest-net tests services that use SSL- or TLS-based protocols,
it will check that the server certificate has not expired. This check
happens automatically for https (secure web), pop3s, imaps, nntps
and all other SSL-enabled services (except ldap, see LDAP TESTS 
below).

All certificates found for a host are reported in one status message.

Note: On most systems, the end-date of the certificate is limited to
Jan 19th, 2038. If your certificate is valid after this date, bbtest-net
will report it as valid only until Jan 19, 2038. This is due to
limitations in your operating system C library.


.SH LDAP TESTS
ldap testing can be done in two ways. If you just put an "ldap" or
"ldaps" tag in bb-hosts, a simple test is performed that just verifies
that it is possible to establish a connection to the port running 
the ldap service (389 for ldap, 636 for ldaps).

Instead you can put an LDAP URI in bb-hosts. This will cause 
bbtest-net to initiate a full-blown LDAP session with the server,
and do an LDAP search for the objects defined by the URI. This
requires that bbtest-net was built with LDAP support, and relies
on an existing LDAP library to be installed.  It has been tested 
with OpenLDAP 2.0.26 (from Red Hat 9) and 2.1.22.  The Solaris 8 
system ldap library has also been confirmed to work for un-encrypted 
(plain ldap) access.

The format of LDAP URI's is defined in RFC 2255. LDAP URLs look like this:
.nf

  \fBldap://\fP\fIhostport\fP\fB/\fP\fIdn\fP[\fB?\fP\fIattrs\fP[\fB?\fP\fIscope\fP[\fB?\fP\fIfilter\fP[\fB?\fP\fIexts\fP]]]]

where:
  \fIhostport\fP is a host name with an optional ":portnumber"
  \fIdn\fP is the search base
  \fIattrs\fP is a comma separated list of attributes to request
  \fIscope\fP is one of these three strings:
    base one sub (default=base)
  \fIfilter\fP is filter
  \fIexts\fP are recognized set of LDAP and/or API extensions.

Example:
  ldap://ldap.example.net/dc=example,dc=net?cn,sn?sub?(cn=*)
.fi
.sp
All "bind" operations to LDAP servers use simple authentication.
Kerberos and SASL are not supported. If your LDAP server requires 
a username/password, use the "ldaplogin" tag to specify this, cf. 
.I bb-hosts(5) 
If no username/password information is provided, an anonymous
bind will be attempted. 

SSL support requires both a client library and an LDAP server that support LDAPv3; 
it uses the LDAP "STARTTLS" protocol request after establishing a connection to 
the standard (non-encrypted) LDAP port (usually port 389). It has only been
tested with OpenSSL 2.x, and probably will not work with any other LDAP library.

The older LDAPv2 experimental method of tunnelling normal LDAP traffic through an 
SSL connection - ldaps, running on port 636 - is not supported, unless someone 
can explain how to get the OpenLDAP library to support it. This method was never
formally described in an RFC, and implementations of it are non-standard.

For a discussion of the various ways of running encrypted ldap, see
.br
http://www.openldap.org/lists/openldap-software/200305/msg00079.html
.br
http://www.openldap.org/lists/openldap-software/200305/msg00084.html

.br
http://www.openldap.org/lists/openldap-software/200206/msg00387.html

When testing LDAP URI's, all of the communications are handled 
by the ldap library. Therefore, it is not possible to obtain the 
SSL certificate used by the LDAP server, and it will not show up 
in the "sslcert" column.


.SH USING MULTIPLE NETWORK TEST SYSTEMS
If you have more than one system running network tests - e.g. if your network
is separated by firewalls - then is is problematic to maintain
multiple bb-hosts files for each of the systems.
bbtest-net supports the NET:location tag in
.I bb-hosts(5)
to distinguish 
between hosts that should be tested from different network
locations. If you set the environment variable BBLOCATION
e.g. to "dmz" before running bbtest-net, then it will only
test hosts that have a "NET:dmz" tag in bb-hosts. This allows
you to keep all of your hosts in the same bb-hosts file, but
test different sets of hosts by different BBNET systems.


.SH BBTEST-NET INTERNALS
bbtest-net first reads the bb-services file to see which network tests
are defined. It then scans the bb-hosts file, and collects information
about the TCP service tests that need to be tested. It picks out only
the tests that were listed in the bb-services file, plus the "dns",
"dig" and "ntp" tests - those tests that bb-network.sh would normally 
use the "bbnet" tool to test.

It then runs two tasks in parallel: First, a separate process is
started to run the "hobbitping" tool for the connectivity tests. While 
hobbitping is busy doing the "ping" checks, bbtest-net runs all of the
TCP-based network tests.

All of the TCP-based service checks are handled by a connection
tester written specifically for this purpose. It uses only standard
Unix-style network programming, but relies on the Unix "select(2)" 
system-call to handle many simultaneous connections happening in 
parallel. Exactly how many parallel connections are being used 
depends on your operating system - the default is FD_SETSIZE/4,
which amounts to 256 on many Unix systems.

You can choose the number of concurrent connections with the
"--concurrency=N" option to bbtest-net.

Connection attempts timeout after 10 seconds - this can be
changed with the "--timeout=N" option.

Both of these settings play a part in deciding how long the testing
takes. A conservative estimate for doing N TCP tests is:

   (1 + (N / concurrency)) * timeout

In real life it will probably be less, as the above formula is for
every test to require a timeout. Since the most normal use of BB
is to check for services that are active, you should have a lot
less timeouts.

The "ntp" and "rpcinfo" checks rely on external programs to 
do each test. Thus, they perform only marginally better than the
standard bb-network.sh script. 

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.IP BBLOCATION
Defines the network segment where bbtest-net is currently running.
This is used to filter out only the entries in the
.I bb-hosts(5)
file that have a matching "NET:LOCATION" tag, and execute the
tests for only those hosts.

.IP BBMAXMSGSPERCOMBO 
Defines the maximum number of status messages that can be sent in 
one combo message. Default is 0 - no limit.
.br
In practice, the maximum size of a single Xymon message
sets a limit - the default value for the maximum message
size is 32 KB, but that will easily accomodate 100 status
messages per transmission. So if you want to experiment
with this setting, I suggest starting with a value of 10.

.IP BBSLEEPBETWEENMSGS
Defines a a delay (in microseconds) after each 
message is transmitted to the BBDISPLAY server. The default 
is 0, i.e.  send the messages as fast as possible.
This gives your BBDISPLAY server some time to process the
message before the next message comes in. Depending on
the speed of your BBDISPLAY server, it may be necessary
to set this value to half a second or even 1 or 2 seconds.
Note that the value is specified in MICROseconds, so to
define a delay of half a second, this must be set to
the value "500000"; a delay of 1 second is achieved by
setting this to "1000000" (one million).

.IP FPING
Command used to run the 
.I hobbitping(1) 
utility. Used by bbtest-net for connectivity (ping) testing.  See 
.I hobbitserver.cfg(5)
for more information about how to customize the program that is
executed to do ping tests.

.IP TRACEROUTE
Location of the 
.I traceroute(8)
utility, or an equivalent tool e.g.
.I mtr(8).
Optionally used when a connectivity test fails to pinpoint the
network location that is causing the failure.

.IP NTPDATE
Location of the 
.I ntpdate(1) 
utility. Used by bbtest-net when checking the "ntp" service.

.IP RPCINFO
Location of the 
.I rpcinfo(8) 
utility. Used by bbtest-net for the "rpc" service checks.

.SH FILES
.IP "~/server/etc/bb-services"
This file contains definitions of TCP services that bbtest-net
can test. Definitions for a default set of common services is built
into bbtest-net, but these can be overridden or supplemented by
defining services in the bb-services file. See 
.I bb-services(5)
for details on this file.

.IP "$BBHOME/etc/netrc - authentication data for password-protected webs"
If you have password-protected sites, you can put the usernames and 
passwords for these here. They will then get picked up automatically
when running your network tests.  This works for web-sites that use 
the "Basic" authentication scheme in HTTP.
See 
.I ftp(1)
for details - a sample entry would look like this
.br
   machine www.acme.com login fred password Wilma1
.br
Note that the machine-name must be the name you use in the
http://machinename/ URL setting - it need not be the one you
use for the system-name in Xymon.

.sp
.IP "$BBHOME/etc/cookies"
This file may contain website cookies, in the Netscape HTTP
Cookie format. If a website requires a static cookie to be 
present in order for the check to complete, then you can add
this cookie to this file, and it will be sent along with the 
HTTP request. To get the cookies into this file, you can use
the "curl --cookie-jar FILE" to request the URL that sets
the cookie.
.sp
.IP "$BBTMP/*.status - test status summary"
Each time bbtest-net runs, if any tests fail (i.e. they result
in a red status) then they will be listed in a file name
TESTNAME.[LOCATION].status. The LOCATION part may be null. This
file is used to determine how long the failure has lasted, which
in turn decides if this test should be included in the tests done by
.I bbretest-net.sh(1)
.br
It is also used internally by bbtest-net when determining the
color for tests that use the "badconn" or "badTESTNAME" tags.
.sp
.IP $BBTMP/frequenttests.[LOCATION]
This file contains the hostnames of those hosts that should be
retested by the
.I bbretest-net.sh(1)
test tool. It is updated only by bbtest-net during the normal
runs, and read by bbretest-net.sh.
