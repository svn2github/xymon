xymond - Master network daemon for a Xymon server
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>xymond [options]</B>

<P>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

xymond is the core daemon in the Xymon Monitor.
It is designed to handle monitoring of a large number of hosts, 
with a strong focus on being a high-speed, low-overhead implementation 
of a Big Brother compatible server.
<P>
To achieve this, xymond stores all information about the state
of the monitored systems in memory, instead of storing it in
the host filesystem. A number of plug-ins can be enabled to
enhance the basic operation; e.g. a set of plugins are provided
to implement persistent storage in a way that is compatible 
with the Big Brother daemon. However, even with these
plugins enabled, xymond still performs much faster than the
standard bbd daemon.
<P>
xymond is normally started and controlled by the
<I><A HREF="../man8/xymonlaunch.8.html">xymonlaunch</A>(8)</I>

tool, and the command used to invoke xymond should therefore be
in the tasks.cfg file.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>--hosts=FILENAME<DD>
Specifies the path to the Xymon hosts.cfg file. This is used
to check if incoming status messages refer to known hosts; depending
on the &quot;--ghosts&quot; option, messages for unknown hosts may be dropped.
If this option is omitted, the default path used is set by the HOSTSCFG
environment variable.
<P>
<DT>--checkpoint-file=FILENAME<DD>
With regular intervals, xymond will dump all of its internal state 
to this check-point file. It is also dumped when xymond terminates,
or when it receives a SIGUSR1 signal.
<P>
<DT>--checkpoint-interval=N<DD>
Specifies the interval (in seconds) between dumps to the check-point
file. The default is 900 seconds (15 minutes).
<P>
<DT>--restart=FILENAME<DD>
Specifies an existing file containing a previously generated xymond 
checkpoint. When starting up, xymond will restore its internal state
from the information in this file. You can use the same filename for
&quot;--checkpoint-file&quot; and &quot;--restart&quot;.
<P>
<DT>--ghosts={allow|drop|log|match}<DD>
How to handle status messages from unknown hosts. The &quot;allow&quot; setting
accepts all status messages, regardless of whether the host is known
in the hosts.cfg file or not. &quot;drop&quot; silently ignores reports from unknown 
hosts. &quot;log&quot; works like drop, but logs the event in the xymond output file.
&quot;match&quot; will try to match the name of the unknown host reporting with 
the known names by ignoring any domain-names - if a match is found, then
a temporary client alias is automatically generated. The default is &quot;log&quot;. 
<P>
<DT>--no-purple<DD>
Prevent status messages from going purple when they are no longer valid.
Unlike the standard bbd daemon, purple-handling is done by xymond.
<P>
<DT>--listen=IP[:PORT]<DD>
Specifies the IP-address and port where xymond will listen for incoming
connections. By default, xymond listens on IP 0.0.0.0 (i.e. all IP-
adresses available on the host) and port 1984.
<P>
<DT>--daemon<DD>
xymond is normally started by 
<I><A HREF="../man8/xymonlaunch.8.html">xymonlaunch</A>(8)</I>


it will then detach from the terminal and continue running as a background
task.
<P>
<DT>--timeout=N<DD>
Set the timeout used for incoming connections. If a status has not been
received more than N seconds after the connection was accepted, then
the connection is dropped and any status message is discarded.
Default: 10 seconds.
<P>
<DT>--flap-count=N<DD>
Track the N latest status-changes for flap-detection. See the
<B>--flap-seconds</B> option also. To disable flap-checks, set
N to zero.
Default: 5
<P>
<DT>--flap-seconds=N<DD>
If a status changes more than <B>flap-count</B> times in N seconds or 
less, then it is considered to be flapping. In that case, the status 
is locked at the most severe level until the flapping stops. The 
history information is not updated after the flapping is detected. 
<B>NOTE:</B> If this is set higher than the default value, you should 
also use the <B>--flap-count</B> option to ensure that enough status-changes 
are stored for flap detection to work. The flap-count setting should be
at least (N/300)-1, e.g. if you set flap-seconds to 3600 (1 hour), then 
flap-count should be at least (3600/300)-1, i.e. 11.
Default: 1800 seconds (30 minutes).
<P>
<DT>--delay-red=N<DD>
Sets the delay before a red/yellow status causes a change in the web
page display. Is usually controlled on a per-host basis via the
<B>delayred</B> and <B>delayyellow</B> settings in
<I><A HREF="../man5/hosts.cfg.5.html">hosts.cfg</A>(5)</I>

but these options allow you to set a default value for the delays.
The value N is in minutes. Default: 0 minutes (no delay).
Note: Since most tests only execute once every 5 minutes, it will
usually not make sense to set N to anything but a multiple of 5.
<P>
<DT>--env=FILENAME<DD>
Loads the content of FILENAME as environment settings before starting
xymond. This is mostly used when running as a stand-alone daemon; if
xymond is started by xymonlaunch, the environment settings are controlled
by the xymonlaunch tasks.cfg file.
<P>
<DT>--pidfile=FILENAME<DD>
xymond writes the process-ID it is running with to this file.
This is for use in automated startup scripts. The default file is
$XYMONSERVERLOGS/xymond.pid.
<P>
<DT>--log=FILENAME<DD>
Redirect all output from xymond to FILENAME.
<P>
<DT>--store-clientlogs[=[!]COLUMN]<DD>
Determines which status columns can cause a client message to be
broadcast to the CLICHG channel. By default, no client messages 
are pushed to the CLICHG channel. If this option is specified with
no parameter list, all status columns that go into an alert state
will trigger the client data to be sent to the CLICHG channel. If
a paramater list is added to this option, only those status columns
listed in the list will cause the client data to be sent to the
CLICHG channel. Several column names can be listed, separated by
commas. If all columns are given as &quot;!COLUMNNAME&quot;, then all status
columns except those listed will cause the client data to be sent.
<P>
<DT>--status-senders=IP[/MASK][,IP/MASK]<DD>
Controls which hosts may send &quot;status&quot;, &quot;combo&quot;, &quot;config&quot; and &quot;query&quot;
commands to xymond.
<P>
By default, any host can send status-updates. If this option is used, 
then status-updates are accepted only if they are sent by one of the 
IP-adresses listed here, or if they are sent from the IP-address of the 
host that the updates pertains to (this is to allow Xymon clients to send in their
own status updates, without having to list all clients here). So typically
you will need to list your servers running network tests here.
<P>
The format of this option is a list of IP-adresses, optionally with a
network mask in the form of the number of bits. E.g. if you want to 
accept status-updates from the host 172.16.10.2, you would use
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--status-senders=172.16.10.2
<BR>

whereas if you want to accept status updates from both 172.16.10.2 and
from all of the hosts on the 10.0.2.* network (a 24-bit IP network), you
would use
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--status-senders=172.16.10.2,10.0.2.0/24
<P>
<DT>--maint-senders=IP[/MASK][,IP/MASK]<DD>
Controls which hosts may send maintenance commands to xymond. Maintenance
commands are the &quot;enable&quot;, &quot;disable&quot;, &quot;ack&quot; and &quot;notes&quot; commands. Format
of this option is as for the --status-senders option. It is strongly
recommended that you use this to restrict access to these commands, so
that monitoring of a host cannot be disabled by a rogue user - e.g. to
hide a system compromise from the monitoring system.
<P>
<B>Note:</B> If messages are sent through a proxy, the IP-address restrictions
are of little use, since the messages will appear to originate from the
proxy server address. It is therefore strongly recommended that you do NOT
include the address of a server running xymonproxy in the list of allowed addresses.
<P>
<DT>--www-senders=IP[/MASK][,IP/MASK]<DD>
Controls which hosts may send commands to retrieve the state of xymond. These
are the &quot;xymondlog&quot;, &quot;xymondboard&quot; and &quot;xymondxboard&quot; commands, which are used
by
<I><A HREF="../man1/xymongen.1.html">xymongen</A>(1)</I>

and
<I><A HREF="../man1/combostatus.1.html">combostatus</A>(1)</I>

to retrieve the state of the Xymon system so they can generate the Xymon webpages.
<P>
<B>Note:</B> If messages are sent through a proxy, the IP-address restrictions
are of little use, since the messages will appear to originate from the
proxy server address. It is therefore strongly recommended that you do NOT
include the address of a server running xymonproxy in the list of allowed addresses.
<P>
<DT>--admin-senders=IP[/MASK][,IP/MASK]<DD>
Controls which hosts may send administrative commands to xymond. These
commands are the &quot;drop&quot; and &quot;rename&quot; commands. Access to these should be 
restricted, since they provide an un-authenticated means of completely
disabling monitoring of a host, and can be used to remove all traces of e.g.
a system compromise from the Xymon monitor.
<P>
<B>Note:</B> If messages are sent through a proxy, the IP-address restrictions
are of little use, since the messages will appear to originate from the
proxy server address. It is therefore strongly recommended that you do NOT
include the address of a server running xymonproxy in the list of allowed addresses.
<P>
<DT>--no-download<DD>
Disable the &quot;download&quot; and &quot;config&quot; commands which can be used by clients
to pull files from the Xymon server. The use of these may be seen as a 
security risk since they allow file downloads.
<P>
<DT>--debug<DD>
Enable debugging output.
<P>
<DT>--dbghost=HOSTNAME<DD>
For troubleshooting problems with a specific host, it may be useful to track
the exact communications from a single host. This option causes xymond to
dump all traffic from a single host to the file &quot;/tmp/xymond.dbg&quot;.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>HOW ALERTS TRIGGER</H2>

When a status arrives, xymond matches the old and new color against
the &quot;alert&quot; colors (from the &quot;ALERTCOLORS&quot; setting) and the &quot;OK&quot; colors 
(from the &quot;OKCOLORS&quot; setting). The old and new color falls into one of three
categories:
<P>
<B>OK:</B>

The color is one of the &quot;OK&quot; colors (e.g. &quot;green&quot;).
<P>
<B>ALERT:</B>

The color is one of the &quot;alert&quot; colors (e.g. &quot;red&quot;).
<P>
<B>UNDECIDED:</B>

The color is neither an &quot;alert&quot; color nor an &quot;OK&quot; color (e.g. &quot;yellow&quot;).
<P>
If the new status shows an ALERT state, then a message to the
<I><A HREF="../man8/xymond_alert.8.html">xymond_alert</A>(8) </I>

module is triggered. This may be a repeat of a previous alert, but 
<I><A HREF="../man8/xymond_alert.8.html">xymond_alert</A>(8)</I>

will handle that internally, and only send alert messages with the
interval configured in 
<I><A HREF="../man5/alerts.cfg.5.html">alerts.cfg</A>(5).</I>

<P>
If the status goes from a not-OK state (ALERT or UNDECIDED) to OK, 
and there is a record of having been in a ALERT state previously, 
then a recovery message is triggered.
<P>
The use of the OK, ALERT and UNDECIDED states make it possible to
avoid being flooded with alerts when a status flip-flops between
e.g yellow and red, or green and yellow.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CHANNELS</H2>

A lot of functionality in the Xymon server is delegated to &quot;worker modules&quot;
that are fed various events from xymond via a &quot;channel&quot;. Programs access a
channel using IPC mechanisms - specifically, shared memory and semaphores -
or by using an instance of the
<I><A HREF="../man8/xymond_channel.8.html">xymond_channel</A>(8)</I>

intermediate program. xymond_channel enables access to a channel via a
simple file I/O interface.
<P>
A skeleton program for hooking into a xymond channel is provided as
part of Xymon in the
<I><A HREF="../man8/xymond_sample.8.html">xymond_sample</A>(8)</I>

program.
<P>
The following channels are provided by xymond:
<P>
<B>status</B>

This channel is fed the contents of all incoming &quot;status&quot; and
&quot;summary&quot; messages.
<P>
<B>stachg</B>

This channel is fed information about tests that change status,
i.e. the color of the status-log changes.
<P>
<B>page</B>

This channel is fed information about tests where the color changes
between an alert color and a non-alert color. It also receives 
information about &quot;ack&quot; messages.
<P>
<B>data</B>

This channel is fed information about all &quot;data&quot; messages.
<P>
<B>notes</B>

This channel is fed information about all &quot;notes&quot; messages.
<P>
<B>enadis</B>

This channel is fed information about hosts or tests that are
being disabled or enabled.
<P>
<B>client</B>

This channel is fed the contents of the client messages sent
by Xymon clients installed on the monitored servers.
<P>
<B>clichg</B>

This channel is fed the contents of a host client messages,
whenever a status for that host goes red, yellow or purple.
<P>
Information about the data stream passed on these channels is
in the Xymon source-tree, see the &quot;xymond/new-daemon.txt&quot; file.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SIGNALS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>SIGHUP<DD>
Re-read the hosts.cfg configuration file.
<P>
<DT>SIGUSR1<DD>
Force an immediate dump of the checkpoint file.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

Timeout of incoming connections are not strictly enforced. The check
for a timeout only triggers during the normal network handling loop,
so a connection that should timeout after N seconds may persist until
some activity happens on another (unrelated) connection.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FILES</H2>

If ghost-handling is enabled via the &quot;--ghosts&quot; option, the hosts.cfg
file is read to determine the names of all known hosts.
