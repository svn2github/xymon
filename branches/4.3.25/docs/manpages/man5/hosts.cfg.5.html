<H2>NAME</H2>

hosts.cfg - Main Xymon configuration file
<P>
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>hosts.cfg<DD>
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<I><A HREF="../man5/hosts.cfg.5.html">hosts.cfg</A>(5)</I>

file is the most important configuration file for all of the
Xymon programs.  This file contains the full list of 
all the systems monitored by Xymon, including the set 
of tests and other configuration items stored for each host.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FILE FORMAT</H2>

Each line of the file defines a host. Blank lines and lines
starting with a hash mark (#) are treated as comments and ignored.
Long lines can be broken up by putting a backslash at the end of 
the line and continuing the entry on the next line.
<P>
The format of an entry in the hosts.cfg file is as follows:
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IP-address&nbsp;hostname&nbsp;#&nbsp;tag1&nbsp;tag2&nbsp;...
<P>
The IP-address and hostname are mandatory; all of the tags are optional.
Listing a host with only IP-address and hostname will cause a network
test to be executed for the host - the connectivity test is enabled
by default, but no other tests.
<P>
The optional tags are then used to define which tests are 
relevant for the host, and also to set e.g. the time-interval used
for availability reporting by
<I><A HREF="../man1/xymongen.1.html">xymongen</A>(1)</I>

<P>
An example of setting up the hosts.cfg file is in the Xymon on-line 
documentation (from the Help menu, choose &quot;Configuring Monitoring&quot;).
The following describes the possible settings in a hosts.cfg
file supported by Xymon.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>TAGS RECOGNIZED BY ALL TOOLS</H2>

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>include filename<DD>
This tag is used to include another file into the hosts.cfg
file at run-time, allowing for a large hosts.cfg file to be
split up into more manageable pieces.
<P>
The &quot;filename&quot; argument should point to a file that uses the
same syntax as hosts.cfg. The filename can be an absolute 
filename (if it begins with a '/'), or a relative filename -
relative file names are prefixed with the directory where
the main hosts.cfg file is located (usually $XYMONHOME/etc/).
<P>
You can nest include tags, i.e. a file that is included 
from the main hosts.cfg file can itself include other files.
<P>
<DT>dispinclude filename<DD>
Acts like the &quot;include&quot; tag, but only for the xymongen tool.
Can be used e.g. to put a group of hosts on multiple sub-pages,
without having to repeat the host definitions.
<P>
<DT>netinclude filename<DD>
Acts like the &quot;include&quot; tag, but only for the xymonnet tool.
<P>
<DT>directory directoryname<DD>
This tag is used to include all files in the named directory.
Files are included in alphabetical order. If there are sub-
directories, these are recursively included also. The following 
files are ignored: Files that begin with a dot, files that end
with a tilde, RCS files that end with &quot;,v&quot;, RPM package manager
files ending in &quot;.rpmsave&quot; or &quot;.rpmnew&quot;, DPKG package manager
files ending in &quot;.dpkg-new&quot; or &quot;.dpkg-orig&quot;, and all special
files (devices, sockets, pipes etc).
<P>
<DT>optional include/directory<DD>
Both &quot;include&quot; and &quot;directory&quot; can be prefixed with the tag

the file or directory is not present on a system.
<P>
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>GENERAL PER-HOST OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>noclear<DD>
Controls whether stale status messages go purple or clear when
a host is down. Normally, when a host is down the client statuses
(&quot;cpu&quot;, &quot;disk&quot;, &quot;memory&quot; etc) will stop updating - this would usually
make them go &quot;purple&quot; which can trigger alerts. To avoid that, Xymon
checks if the &quot;conn&quot; test has failed, and if that is true then the
other tests will go &quot;clear&quot; instead of purple so you only get alerts
for the &quot;conn&quot; test. If you do want the stale statuses to go purple,
you can use the &quot;noclear&quot; tag to override this behaviour.
<P>
Note that &quot;noclear&quot; also affects the behaviour of network tests;
see below.
<P>
<DT>prefer<DD>
When a single host is defined multiple time in the hosts.cfg file,
xymongen tries to guess which definition is the best to use for
the information used on the &quot;info&quot; column, or for the NOPROPRED
and other xymongen-specific settings. Host definitions that have
a &quot;noconn&quot; tag or an IP of 0.0.0.0 get lower priority.
<P>
By using the &quot;prefer&quot; tag you tell xymongen that this host definition
should be used.
<P>
Note: This only applies to hosts that are defined multiple
times in the hosts.cfg file, although it will not hurt to add it
on other hosts as well.
<P>
<DT>multihomed<DD>
Tell Xymon that data from the host can arrive from multiple IP-addresses.
By default, Xymon will warn if it sees data for one host coming from
different IP-addresses, because this usually indicates a mis-configuration
of the hostname on at least one of the servers involved. Some hosts
with multiple IP-addresses may use different IP's for sending data to
Xymon, however. This tag disables the check of source IP when receiving
data.
<P>
<DT>delayred=STATUSCOLUMN:DELAY[,STATUSCOLUMN:DELAY...]<DD>
Usually, status changes happen immediately. This tag is used to defer
an update to red for the STATUSCOLUMN status for DELAY minutes. E.g.
with <B>delayred=disk:10,cpu:30</B>, a red disk-status will not appear
on the Xymon webpages until it has been red for at least 10 minutes.
Note: Since most tests only execute once every 5 minutes, it will
usually not make sense to set N to anything but a multiple of 5. The
exception is network tests, since 
<I><A HREF="../man1/xymonnet-again.sh.1.html">xymonnet-again.sh</A>(1)</I>

will re-run failed network tests once a minute for up to 30 minutes.
<P>
<DT>delayyellow=STATUSCOLUMN:DELAY[,STATUSCOLUMN:DELAY...]<DD>
Same as <B>delayred</B>, but defers the change to a yellow status.
<P>
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>XYMONGEN DISPLAY OPTIONS</H2>

These tags are processed by the 
<I><A HREF="../man1/xymongen.1.html">xymongen</A>(1)</I>

tool when generating the Xymon webpages or reports.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>page NAME [Page-title]<DD>
This defines a page at the level below the entry page. All
hosts following the &quot;page&quot; directive appear on this page, until 
a new &quot;page&quot;, &quot;subpage&quot; or &quot;subparent&quot; line is found.
<P>
<DT>subpage NAME [Page-title]<DD>
This defines a sub-page in the second level below the entry page.
You must have a previous &quot;page&quot; line to hook this sub-page to.
<P>
<DT>subparent parentpage newpage [Page-title]<DD>
This is used to define sub-pages in whatever levels you may
wish. Just like the standard &quot;subpage&quot; tag, &quot;subparent&quot; defines a
new Xymon web page; however with &quot;subparent&quot; you explicitly
list which page it should go as a sub-page to. You can pick
any page as the parent - pages, sub-pages or even other
subparent pages. So this allows you to define any tree
structure of pages that you like.
<P>
E.g. with this in hosts.cfg:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;page&nbsp;USA&nbsp;United&nbsp;States
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subpage&nbsp;NY&nbsp;New&nbsp;York
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subparent&nbsp;NY&nbsp;manhattan&nbsp;Manhattan&nbsp;data&nbsp;centers
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subparent&nbsp;manhattan&nbsp;wallstreet&nbsp;Wall&nbsp;Street&nbsp;center
<P>
you get this hierarchy of pages:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;USA&nbsp;(United&nbsp;States)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NY&nbsp;(New&nbsp;York)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;manhattan&nbsp;(Manhattan&nbsp;data&nbsp;centers)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wallstreet&nbsp;(Wall&nbsp;Street&nbsp;center)
<P>
Note: The parent page must be defined before you define
the subparent. If not, the page will not be generated,
and you get a message in the log file.
<P>
Note: xymongen is case-sensitive, when trying to match the
name of the parent page.
<P>
The inspiration for this came from Craig Cook's mkbb.pl
script, and I am grateful to Craig for suggesting that
I implement it in xymongen. The idea to explicitly list
the parent page in the &quot;subparent&quot; tag was what made
it easy to implement.
<P>
<DT>vpage<DD>
These are page-definitions similar to the &quot;page&quot;, &quot;subpage&quot; and
&quot;subparent&quot; definitions. However, on these pages the rows are 
the tests, and the columns are the hosts (normal pages have it
the other way around). This is useful if you have a very large
number of tests for a few hosts, and prefer to have them listed
on a page that can be scrolled vertically.
<BR>

Note that the &quot;group&quot; directives have no effect on these types
of pages.
<P>
<DT>group [group-title]<DD>
<DT>group-compress [group-title]<DD>
Defines a group of hosts, that appear together on the web page,
with a single header-line listing all of the columns. Hosts
following the &quot;group&quot; line appear inside the group, until a
new &quot;group&quot; or page-line is found. The two group-directives
are handled identically by Xymon and xymongen, but both forms
are allowed for backwards compatibility.
<P>
<DT>group-sorted [group-title]<DD>
Same as the &quot;group&quot; line, but will sort the hosts inside the
group so they appear in strict lexicographic order.
<P>
<DT>group-only COLUMN1|COLUMN2|COLUMN3 [group-title]<DD>
Same as the &quot;group&quot; and &quot;group-compress&quot; lines, but includes
only the columns explicitly listed in the group. Any columns
not listed will be ignored for these hosts.
<P>
<DT>group-except COLUMN1|COLUMN2|COLUMN3 [group-title]<DD>
Same as the &quot;group-only&quot; lines, but includes all columns EXCEPT
those explicitly listed in the group. Any columns listed will 
be ignored for these hosts - all other columns are shown.
<P>
<DT>title Page, group or host title text<DD>
The &quot;title&quot; tag is used to put custom headings into the
pages generated by xymongen, in front of page/subpage links,
groups or hosts.
<P>
The title tag operates on the next item in the hosts.cfg
file following the title tag.
<P>
If a title tag precedes a host entry, the title is 
shown just before the host is listed on the status
page. The column headings present for the host will
be repeated just after the heading.
<P>
If a title tag precedes a group entry, the title is
show just before the group on the status page. 
<P>
If a title tag precedes a page/subpage/subparent
entry, the title text replaces the normal &quot;Pages hosted
locally&quot; heading normally inserted by Xymon. This
appears on the page that links to the sub-pages,
not on the sub-page itself. To get a custom heading on
the sub-page, you may want to use the &quot;--pagetext-heading&quot;
when running
<I><A HREF="../man1/xymongen.1.html">xymongen</A>(1)</I>

<P>
<DT>NAME:hostname<DD>
Overrides the default hostname used on the overview web pages.
If &quot;hostname&quot; contains spaces, it must be enclosed in double
quotes, e.g. NAME:&quot;R&amp;D Oracle Server&quot;
<P>
<DT>CLIENT:hostname<DD>
Defines an alias for a host, which will be used when identifying
status messages. This is typically used to accommodate a local
client that sends in status reports with a different hostname,
e.g. if you use hostnames with domains in your Xymon configuration,
but the client is a silly Window box that does not include the
hostname. Or vice-versa. Whatever the reason, this can be used
to match status reports with the hosts you define in your
hosts.cfg file. It causes incoming status reports with the
specified hostname to be filed using the hostname defined in
hosts.cfg.
<P>
<DT>NOCOLUMNS:column[,column]<DD>
Used to drop certain of the status columns generated by the
Xymon client. <B>column</B> is one of <B>cpu</B>, <B>disk</B>,
<B>files</B>, <B>memory</B>, <B>msgs</B>, <B>ports</B>, <B>procs</B>.
This setting stops these columns from being updated for the 
host. Note: If the columns already exist, you must use the
<I><A HREF="../man1/xymon.1.html">xymon</A>(1)</I>

utility to <B>drop</B> them, or they will go purple.
<P>
<DT>COMMENT:Host comment<DD>
Adds a small text after the hostname on the web page. This can
be used to describe the host, without completely changing its
display-name as the NAME: tag does. If the comment includes
whitespace, it must be in double-quotes, e.g. COMMENT:&quot;Sun web server&quot;
<P>
<DT>DESCR:Hosttype:Description<DD>
Define some informational text about the host. The &quot;Hosttype&quot;
is a text describing the type of this device - &quot;router&quot;, &quot;switch&quot;,
&quot;hub&quot;, &quot;server&quot; etc. The &quot;Description&quot; is an informational
text that will be shown on the &quot;Info&quot; column page; this can
e.g. be used to store information about the physical location
of the device, contact persons etc. If the text contain whitespace,
you must enclose it in double-quotes, e.g.  DESCR:&quot;switch:4th floor Marketing switch&quot;
<P>
<DT>CLASS:Classname<DD>
Force the host to belong to a specific class. Class-names are used
when configuring log-file monitoring (they can be used as references in
<I><A HREF="../man5/client-local.cfg.5.html">client-local.cfg</A>(5),</I>

<I><A HREF="../man5/analysis.cfg.5.html">analysis.cfg</A>(5)</I>

and
<I><A HREF="../man5/alerts.cfg.5.html">alerts.cfg</A>(5)</I>

to group log file checks or alerts). Normally, class-names are controlled on the 
client by starting the Xymon client with the &quot;--class=Classname&quot; option.
If you specify it in the hosts.cfg file on the Xymon server, it overrides
any class name that the client reports. If not set, then the host belongs
to a class named by the operating system the Xymon client is running on.
<P>
<DT>dialup<DD>
The keyword &quot;dialup&quot; for a host means that it is OK for it to be
off-line - this should not trigger an alert. All network tests
will go &quot;clear&quot; upon failure, and any missing reports from e.g.
cpu- and disk-status will not go purple when they are not updated.
<P>
<DT>nonongreen<DD>
Ignore this host on the &quot;All non-green&quot; page. Even if it has an active alert,
it will not be included in the &quot;All non-green&quot; page. This also removes the
host from the event-log display.
<P>
<DT>nodisp<DD>
Ignore this host completely when generating the Xymon webpages.
Can be useful for monitoring a host without having it show up on
the webpages, e.g. because it is not yet in production use. Or for
hiding a host that is shown only on a second pageset.
<P>
<DT>TRENDS:[*,][![graph,...]]<DD>
Defines the RRD graphs to include in the &quot;trends&quot; column
generated by xymongen.  This option syntax is complex.
<BR>

If this option is not present, xymongen provides graphs
matching the standard set of RRD files: la, disk, memory, 
users, vmstat, iostat, netstat, tcp, bind, apache, sendmail
<BR>

* If this option is specified, the list of graphs to
include start out as being empty (no graphs).
<BR>

* To include all default graphs, use an asterisk.  E.g. &quot;TRENDS:*&quot;
<BR>

* To exclude a certain graph, specify it prefixed with '!'. E.g. 
to see all graphs except users: &quot;TRENDS:*,!users&quot;
<BR>

* The netstat, vmstat and tcp graphs have many &quot;subgraphs&quot;.
Which of these are shown can be specified like this:
&quot;TRENDS:*,netstat:netstat2|netstat3,tcp:http|smtp|conn&quot;
This will show all graphs, but instead of the normal 
netstat graph, there will be two: The netstat2 and
netstat3 graphs. Instead of the combined tcp graphs showing
all services, there will be three: One for each of
the http, conn and smtp services.
<BR>

<DT>COMPACT:COLUMN=COLUMN1|COLUMN2|COLUMN3[,ditto]<DD>
Collapses a series of statuses into a single column on
the overview web page.
<BR>

<DT>INTERFACES:REGEXP<DD>
On systems with multiple network interfaces, the operating
system may report a number of network interface where the
statistics are of no interest. By default Xymon tracks and 
graphs the traffic on all network interfaces. This option
defines a regular expression, and only those interfaces whose
name matches the expression are tracked.

<H2>XYMON TAGS FOR THE CRITICAL SYSTEMS OVERVIEW PAGE</H2>

<B>NOTE:</B> The &quot;NK&quot; set of tags is deprecated. They will
be supported for Xymon 4.x, but will be dropped in version 5.
It is recommended that you move your critical systems
view to the
<I><A HREF="../man1/criticalview.cgi.1.html">criticalview.cgi</A>(1)</I>

viewer, which has a separate configuration tool,
<I><A HREF="../man1/criticaleditor.cgi.1.html">criticaleditor.cgi</A>(1)</I>

with more facilities than the NK tags in hosts.cfg.
<P>
xymongen will create three sets of pages: The main page xymon.html,
the all-non-green-statuses page (nongreen.html), and a specially
reduced version of nongreen.html with only selected tests (critical.html).
This page includes selected tests that currently have a red
or yellow status.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>NK:testname[,testname]<DD>
NOTE: This has been deprecated, you should use
<I><A HREF="../man1/criticalview.cgi.1.html">criticalview.cgi</A>(1)</I>

instead of the NK tag.
<P>
Define the tests that you want included on the critical page.
E.g. if you have a host where you only want to see the 
http tests on critical.html, you specify it as
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;12.34.56.78&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.acme.com">www.acme.com</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;#&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.acme.com/">http://www.acme.com/</A>&nbsp;NK:http
<P>
If you want multiple tests for a host to show up on the
critical.html page, specify all the tests separated by commas.
The test names correspond to the column names (e.g. 
https tests are covered by an &quot;NK:http&quot; tag).
<P>
<DT>NKTIME=day:starttime:endtime[,day:starttime:endtime]<DD>
This tag limits the time when an active alert is presented
on the NK web page.
<P>
By default, tests with a red or yellow status that are listed
in the &quot;NK:testname&quot; tag will appear on the NK page. However,
you may not want the test to be shown outside of normal
working hours - if, for example, the host is not being
serviced during week-ends.
<P>
You can then use the NKTIME tag to define the time periods
where the alert will show up on the NK page. 
<P>
The time specification consists of
<P>
<B>day-of-week:</B>

<B>W</B> means Mon-Fri (&quot;weekdays&quot;), <B>*</B> means all days, <B>0</B> .. <B>6</B> = Sunday .. Saturday. 
Listing multiple days is possible, e.g. &quot;60&quot; is valid meaning &quot;Saturday and Sunday&quot;.
<P>
<B>starttime:</B>

Time to start showing errors, must be in 24-hour clock format as HHMM hours/minutes. 
E.g. for 8 am enter &quot;0800&quot;, for 9.30 pm enter &quot;2130&quot;
<P>
<B>endtime:</B>

Time to stop showing errors.
<P>
If necessary, multiple periods can be specified. E.g. to
monitor a site 24x7, except between noon and 1 pm, use
NKTIME=*:0000:1159,*:1300:2359
<P>
The interval between start time and end time may cross midnight, e.g. <B>*:2330:0200</B>
would be valid and have the same effect as <B>*:2330:2400,*:0000:0200</B>.
<P>
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>XYMON TAGS FOR THE WML (WAP) CARDS</H2>

If xymongen is run with the &quot;--wml&quot; option, it will generate a
set of WAP-format output &quot;cards&quot; that can be viewed with a
WAP-capable device, e.g. a PDA or cell-phone.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>WML:[+|-]testname[,[+|-]testname]<DD>
This tag determines which tests for this hosts are included
in the WML (WAP) page. Syntax is identical to the NK: tag.  
<P>
The default set of WML tests are taken from the --wml
command line option.  If no &quot;WML:&quot; tag is specified, the 
&quot;NK:&quot; tag is used if present.
<P>
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>XYMON STATUS PROPAGATION OPTIONS</H2>

These tags affect how a status propagates upwards from a single
test to the page and higher. This can also be done with the 
command-line options --nopropyellow and --nopropred, but the tags 
apply to individual hosts, whereas the command line options are global.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>NOPROPRED:[+|-]testname[,[+|-]testname]<DD>
This tag is used to inhibit a yellow or red status from
propagating upwards - i.e. from a test status color to
the (sub)page status color, and further on to xymon.html
or nongreen.html
<P>
If a host-specific tag begins with a '-' or a '+', the
host-specific tags are removed/added to the default 
setting from the command-line option. If the host-specific
tag does not begin with a '+' or a '-', the default setting
is ignored for this host and the NOPROPRED applies to the
tests given with this tag.
<P>
E.g.: xymongen runs with &quot;--nopropred=ftp,smtp&quot;.
&quot;NOPROPRED:+dns,-smtp&quot; gives a NOPROPRED setting of &quot;ftp,dns&quot;
(dns is added to the default, smtp is removed).
&quot;NOPROPRED:dns&quot; gives a setting of &quot;dns&quot; only (the default
is ignored).
<P>
Note: If you set use the &quot;--nopropred=*&quot; command line
option to disable propagation of all alerts, you cannot use
the &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; methods to add or remove from the wildcard
setting. In that case, do not use the &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot; setting,
but simply list the required tests that you want to keep
from propagating.
<P>
<DT>NOPROPYELLOW:[+|-]testname[,[+|-]testname]<DD>
Similar to NOPROPRED: tag, but applies to propagating a yellow
status upwards.
<P>
<DT>NOPROPPURPLE:[+|-]testname[,[+|-]testname]<DD>
Similar to NOPROPRED: tag, but applies to propagating a purple
status upwards.
<P>
<DT>NOPROPACK:[+|-]testname[,[+|-]testname]<DD>
Similar to NOPROPRED: tag, but applies to propagating an 
acknowledged status upwards.
<P>
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>XYMON AVAILABILITY REPORT OPTIONS</H2>

These options affect the way the Xymon availability
reports are processed (see
<I><A HREF="../man1/report.cgi.1.html">report.cgi</A>(1)</I>

for details about availability reports).
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>REPORTTIME=day:starttime:endtime[,day:starttime:endtime]<DD>
This tag defines the time interval where you measure uptime
of a service for reporting purposes.
<P>
When xymongen generates a report, it computes the availability
of each service - i.e. the percentage of time that the 
service is reported as available (meaning: not red).
<P>
By default, this calculation is done on a 24x7 basis, so
no matter when an outage occurs, it counts as downtime.
<P>
The REPORTTIME tag allows you to specify a period of time
other than 24x7 for the service availability calculation.
If you have systems where you only guarantee availability
from e.g. 7 AM to 8 PM on weekdays, you can use
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;REPORTTIME=W:0700:2000
<BR>

and the availability calculation will only be performed
for the service with measurements from this time interval.
<P>
The syntax for REPORTTIME is the same as the one used
by the NKTIME parameter.
<P>
When REPORTTIME is specified, the availability calculation
happens like this:
<P>
* Only measurements done during the given time period is used for the calculation.
<BR>

* &quot;blue&quot; time reduces the length of the report interval,
so if you are generating a report for a 10-hour period 
and there are 20 minutes of &quot;blue&quot; time, then the
availability calculation will consider the reporting 
period to be 580 minutes (10 hours minus 20 minutes).
This allows you to have scheduled downtime during the
REPORTTIME interval without hurting your availability;
this is (I believe) the whole idea of the downtime being
&quot;planned&quot;.
<BR>

* &quot;red&quot; and &quot;clear&quot; status counts as downtime; &quot;yellow&quot;
and &quot;green&quot; count as uptime. &quot;purple&quot; time is ignored.
<P>
The availability calculation correctly handles status changes
that cross into/out of a REPORTTIME interval.
<P>
If no REPORTTIME is given, the standard 24x7 calculation is used.
<P>
<DT>WARNPCT:percentage<DD>
Xymon's reporting facility uses a computed availability threshold
to color services green (100% available), yellow (above threshold,
but less than 100%), or red (below threshold) in the reports.
<P>
This option allows you to set the threshold value on a host-by-host
basis, instead of using a global setting for all hosts. The
threshold is defined as the percentage of the time that the host
must be available, e.g. &quot;WARNPCT:98.5&quot; if you want the threshold to
be at 98.5%
<P>
<DT>noflap[=test1,test2,...]<DD>
Disable flap detection for this host, or for specific tests on this
host. Flap detection is globally controlled by options given to 
xymond on the command line, but, if enabled, it can be disabled 
using this option. 
<P>

<H2>NETWORK TEST SETTINGS</H2>

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>testip<DD>
By default, Xymon will perform a name lookup of the hostname
to get the IP address it will use for network tests. This tag
causes Xymon to use the IP listed in the hosts.cfg file.
<P>
<DT>NET:location<DD>
This tag defines the host as being tested from a specific location.
If xymonnet sees that the environment variable XYMONNETWORK
is set, it will only test the hosts that have a matching
&quot;NET:location&quot; tag in the hosts.cfg file. So this tag is useful
if you have more than one system running network tests, but you 
still want to keep a consolidated hosts.cfg file for all your 
systems.
<P>
Note: The &quot;--test-untagged&quot; option modifies this behaviour,
see
<I><A HREF="../man1/xymonnet.1.html">xymonnet</A>(1)</I>

<P>
<DT>noclear<DD>
Some network tests depend on others. E.g. if the host does not
respond to ping, then there's a good chance that the entire host 
is down and all network tests will fail. Or if the http server
is down, then any web content checks are also likely to fail.
To avoid floods of alerts, the default behaviour is for xymonnet
to change the status of these tests that fail because of another
problem to &quot;clear&quot; instead of &quot;red&quot;. The &quot;noclear&quot; tag disables this
behaviour and causes all failing tests to be reported with their
true color.
<P>
This behaviour can also be implemented on a per-test basis by
putting the &quot;~&quot; flag on any network test.
<P>
Note that &quot;noclear&quot; also affects whether stale status messages
from e.g. a client on the host go purple or clear when the
host is down; see the &quot;noclear&quot; description in the
&quot;GENERAL PER-HOST OPTIONS&quot; section above.
<P>
<DT>nosslcert<DD>
Disables the standard check of any SSL certificates for
this host. By default, if an SSL-enabled service is tested,
a second test result is generated with information about 
the SSL certificate - this tag disables the SSL certificate
checks for the host.
<P>
<DT>ssldays=WARNDAYS:ALARMDAYS<DD>
Define the number of days before an SSL certificate expires,
in which the sslcert status shows a warning (yellow) or
alarm (red) status. These default to the values from the
&quot;--sslwarn&quot; and &quot;--sslalarm&quot; options for the
<I><A HREF="../man1/xymonnet.1.html">xymonnet</A>(1)</I>

tool; the values specified in the &quot;ssldays&quot; tag overrides
the default.
<P>
<DT>sslbits=MINIMUMKEYBITS<DD>
Enable checking of the encryption strength of the SSL protocol
offered by the server. If the server offers encryption using
a key with fewer than MINIMUMKEYBITS bits, the &quot;sslcert&quot;
test will go red. E.g. to check that your server only uses
strong encryption (128 bits or better), use &quot;sslbits=128&quot;.
<P>
<DT>sni<DD>
<DT>nosni<DD>
Enables or disables use of SNI (Server Name Indication) for SSL tests.
<P>
Some SSL implementations cannot handle SSL handshakes with SNI
data, so Xymon by default does not use SNI. This default can be 
changed with the &quot;--sni&quot; option for 
<I><A HREF="../man1/xymonnet.1.html">xymonnet</A>(1)</I>

but can also be managed per host with these tags.
<P>
SNI support was added in Xymon 4.3.13, where the default was to
use SNI. This was changed in 4.3.14 so SNI support is disabled by
default, and the &quot;sni&quot; and &quot;nosni&quot; tags were introduced together
with the &quot;--sni&quot; option for xymonnet.
<P>
<P>
<DT>DOWNTIME=day:starttime:endtime[,day:starttime:endtime]<DD>
<DT>DOWNTIME=columns:day:starttime:endtime:cause[,columns:day:starttime:endtime:cause]<DD>
This tag can be used to ignore failed checks during
specific times of the day - e.g. if you run services that
are only monitored e.g. Mon-Fri 8am-5pm, or you always 
reboot a server every Monday between 5 and 6 pm.
<P>
What happens is that if a test fails during the specified time, 
it is reported with status BLUE instead of red, yellow, or purple. Thus 
you can still see when the service was unavailable, but alarms 
will not be triggered and the downtime is not counted in the 
availability calculations generated by the Xymon reports.
<P>
The &quot;columns&quot; and &quot;cause&quot; settings are optional, but both or 
neither must be specified. &quot;columns&quot; may be a comma-separated 
list of status columns to which DOWNTIME will apply.  The &quot;cause&quot; 
string will be displayed on the status web page to explain why 
the system is down.
<P>
The syntax for DOWNTIME is the same as the one used
by the NKTIME parameter.
<P>
<DT>SLA=day:starttime:endtime[,day:starttime:endtime]<DD>
This tag is now deprecated. Use the DOWNTIME tag instead.
<P>
This tag works the opposite of the DOWNTIME tag - you use 
it to specify the periods of the day that the service should be 
green. Failures OUTSIDE the SLA interval are reported as blue.
<P>
<DT>depends=(testA:host1/test1,host2/test2),(testB:host3/test3),[...]<DD>
This tag allows you to define dependencies between tests.
If &quot;testA&quot; for the current host depends on &quot;test1&quot; for host &quot;host1&quot;
and test &quot;test2&quot; for &quot;host2&quot;, this can be defined with
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;depends=(testA:host1/test1,host2/test2)
<P>
When deciding the color to report for testA, if either host1/test1
failed or host2/test2 failed, if testA has failed also then the color 
of testA will be &quot;clear&quot; instead of red or yellow.
<P>
Since all tests are actually run before the dependencies are evaluated,
you can use any host/test in the dependency - regardless of the actual
sequence that the hosts are listed, or the tests run. It is also valid
to use tests from the same host that the dependency is for. E.g.
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2.3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;foo&nbsp;#&nbsp;<A HREF="http://foo/">http://foo/</A>&nbsp;webmin&nbsp;depends=(webmin:foo/http)
<P>
is valid; if both the http and the webmin tests fail, then webmin
will be reported as clear.
<P>
Note: The &quot;depends&quot; tag is evaluated by xymonnet while
running the network tests. It can therefore only refer to other
network tests that are handled by the same server - there
is currently no way to use the e.g. the status of locally
run tests (disk, cpu, msgs) or network tests from other
servers in a dependency definition. Such dependencies are
silently ignored.
<P>
<DT>badTEST[-weekdays-starttime-endtime]:x:y:z<DD>
NOTE: This has been deprecated, use the <B>delayred</B> and
<B>delayyellow</B> settings instead.
<P>
Normally when a network test fails, the status changes to
red immediately.  With a &quot;badTEST:x:y:z&quot; tag this behaviour changes:
<BR>

* While &quot;z&quot; or more successive tests fail, the column goes RED.
<BR>

* While &quot;y&quot; or more successive tests fail, but fewer than &quot;z&quot;, the column goes YELLOW.
<BR>

* While &quot;x&quot; or more successive tests fail, but fewer than &quot;y&quot;, the column goes CLEAR.
<BR>

* While fewer than &quot;x&quot; successive tests fail, the column stays GREEN.
<P>
The optional time specification can be used to limit this
&quot;badTEST&quot; setting to a particular time of day, e.g. to 
require a longer period of downtime before raising an
alarm during out-of-office hours. The time-specification
uses:
<BR>

* Weekdays: The weekdays this badTEST tag applies, from
0 (Sunday) through 6 (Saturday). Putting &quot;W&quot; here counts
as &quot;12345&quot;, i.e. all working days. Putting &quot;*&quot; here 
counts as all days of the week, equivalent to &quot;0123456&quot;.
<BR>

* start time and end time are specified using 24-hour clocks,
e.g. &quot;badTEST-W-0900-2000&quot; is valid for working days
between 9 AM (09:00) and 8 PM (20:00).
<P>
When using multiple badTEST tags, the LAST one specified
with a matching time-spec is used.
<P>
Note: The &quot;TEST&quot; is replaced by the name of the test, e.g.
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;12.34.56.78&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.foo.com">www.foo.com</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;#&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.foo.com/">http://www.foo.com/</A>&nbsp;badhttp:1:2:4
<P>
defines a http test that goes &quot;clear&quot; after the first failure,
&quot;yellow&quot; after two successive failures, and &quot;red&quot; after four
successive failures.
<P>
For LDAP tests using URL's, use the option &quot;badldapurl&quot;.
For the other network tests, use &quot;badftp&quot;, &quot;badssh&quot; etc.
<P>

<H2>CONNECTIVITY (PING) TEST</H2>

These tags affect the behaviour of the xymonnet connectivity
test.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>noping<DD>
Disables the ping-test, but will keep the &quot;conn&quot; column
on the web display with a notice that it has been disabled.
<P>
<DT>noconn<DD>
Disables the ping-test, and does not put a &quot;conn&quot; column
on the web display.
<P>
<DT>conn<DD>
The &quot;conn&quot; test (which does a ping of the host) is enabled
for all hosts by default, and normally you just want to
disable it using &quot;noconn&quot; or &quot;noping&quot;. However, on the 
rare occasion where you may want to check that a host is
NOT up, you can specify it as an explicit test, and use
the normal test modifiers, e.g. &quot;!conn&quot; will be green 
when the host is NOT up, and red if it does appear on
the network.
<P>
The actual name of the tag - &quot;conn&quot; by default - depends
on the &quot;--ping=TESTNAME&quot; option for xymonnet, as that
decides the testname for the connectivity test.
<P>
<DT>conn={best,|worst,}IP1[,IP2...]<DD>
This adds additional IP-addresses that are pinged during the
normal &quot;conn&quot; test. So the normal &quot;conn&quot; test must be enabled
(the default) before this tag has any effect. The IP-addresses
listed here are pinged in addition to the main IP-address.
<P>
When multiple IP's are pinged, you can choose if ALL IP's
must respond (the &quot;worst&quot; method), or AT LEAST one IP
must respond (the &quot;best&quot; setting). All of the IP's are 
reported in a single &quot;conn&quot; status, whose color is determined
from the result of pinging the IP's and the best/worst setting.
The default method is &quot;best&quot; - so it will report green if 
just one of the IP's respond to ping.
<P>
<DT>badconn[-weekdays-starttime-endtime]:x:y:z<DD>
This is taken directly from the &quot;fping.sh&quot; connectivity-
testing script, and is used by xymonnet when it runs
with ping testing enabled (the default). See the description
of the &quot;badTEST&quot; tag.
<P>
<DT>route:router1,router2,....<DD>
This tag is taken from the &quot;fping.sh&quot; script, and is used
by xymonnet when run with the &quot;--ping&quot; option to enable
ping testing.
<P>
The router1,router2,... is a comma-separated list of hosts
elsewhere in the hosts.cfg file. You cannot have any spaces
in the list - separate hosts with commas.
<P>
This tag changes the color reported for a ping check that
fails, when one or more of the hosts in the &quot;route&quot; list
is also down. A &quot;red&quot; status becomes &quot;yellow&quot; - other colors
are unchanged. The status message will include information 
about the hosts in the router-list that are down, to aid
tracking down which router is the root cause of the problem.
<P>
Note: Internally, the ping test will still be handled as
&quot;failed&quot;, and therefore any other tests run for this host
will report a status of &quot;clear&quot;.
<P>
<DT>route_LOCATION:router1,router2,...<DD>
If the XYMONNETWORK environment variable is defined, a tag
of &quot;route_XYMONNETWORK:&quot; is recognized by xymonnet with 
the same effect as the normal &quot;route:&quot; tag (see above).
This allows you to have different route: tags for each
server running xymonnet. The actual text for the tag then must
match the value you have for the XYMONNETWORK setting.
E.g. with XYMONNETWORK=dmz, the tag becomes &quot;route_dmz:&quot;
<P>
<DT>trace<DD>
If the connectivity test fails, run a &quot;traceroute&quot;
and include the output from this in the status message
from the failed connectivity test. Note: For this to
work, you may have to define the TRACEROUTE environment
variable, see 
<I><A HREF="../man5/xymonserver.cfg.5.html">xymonserver.cfg</A>(5)</I>

<P>
<DT>notrace<DD>
Similar to the &quot;trace&quot; option, this disables the running
of a traceroute for the host after a failed connectivity
test. It is only used if running traceroute is made the
default via the --trace option.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SIMPLE NETWORK TESTS</H2>

These tests perform a simple network test of a service by connecting
to the port and possibly checking that a banner is shown by the
server.
<P>
How these tests operate are configured in the
<I><A HREF="../man5/protocols.cfg.5.html">protocols.cfg</A>(5)</I>

configuration file, which controls which port to use for the service,
whether to send any data to the service, whether to check for
a response from the service etc.
<P>
You can modify the behaviour of these tests on a per-test basis by
adding one or more modifiers to the test: <B>:NUMBER</B> changes the
port number from the default to the one you specify for this test.
E.g. to test ssh running on port 8022, specify the test as <B>ssh:8022</B>.
<P>
<B>:s</B> makes the test silent, i.e. it does not send any data to
the service. E.g. to do a silent test of an smtp server, enter
<B>smtp:s</B>.
<P>
You can combine these two: <B>ftp:8021:s</B> is valid.
<P>
If you must test a service from a multi-homed host (i.e. using a
specific source IP-address instead of the one your operating system
provides), you can use the modifier &quot;@IPADDRESS&quot; at the end of the
test specification, <B>after</B> any other modifiers or port number.
&quot;IPADDRESS&quot; must be a valid dotted IP-address (not hostname) which
is assigned to the host running the network tests.
<P>
The name of the test also determines the column name that the test 
result will appear with in the Xymon webpages.
<P>
By prefixing a test with &quot;!&quot; it becomes a reverse test: Xymon will 
expect the service NOT to be available, and send a green status if
it does NOT respond. If a connection to the service succeeds, the
status will go red.
<P>
By prefixing a test with &quot;?&quot; errors will be reported with a &quot;clear&quot;
status instead of red. This is known as a test for a &quot;dialup&quot; service,
and allows you to run tests of hosts that are not always online, 
without getting alarms while they are off-line.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>ftp ssh telnet smtp pop3 imap nntp rsync clamd oratns qmtp qmqp<DD>
These tags are for testing services offering the FTP, Secure Shell (ssh), 
SMTP, POP3, IMAP, NNTP, rsync, CLAM anti-virus daemon (clamd), Oracle TNS
listener (oratns), qmail QMTP and QMQP protocols.
<P>
<DT>ftps telnets smtps pop3s imaps nntps<DD>
These tags are for testing of the SSL-tunneled versions of
the standard ftp, telnet, smtp, pop3, imap and nntp protocols. 
If Xymon was configured with support for SSL, you can test these
services like any other network service - xymonnet will
setup an SSL-encrypted session while testing the service.
The server certificate is validated and information about
it sent in the &quot;sslcert&quot; column. Note that smtps does not
have a standard port number assignment, so you will need to enter
this into the protocols.cfg file or your /etc/services file.
<P>
<DT>bbd<DD>
Test that a Big Brother compatible daemon is running. This check
works both for the Xymon
<I><A HREF="../man8/xymond.8.html">xymond</A>(8)</I>

daemon, and the original Big Brother bbd daemon.

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAP">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DNS SERVER TESTS</H2>

These tags are used to setup monitoring of DNS servers.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>dns<DD>
Simple DNS test. It will attempt to lookup the A record for
the hostname of the DNS server.
<P>
<DT>dig<DD>
This is an alias for the &quot;dns&quot; test. In xymonnet, the &quot;dns&quot;
and &quot;dig&quot; tests are handled identically, so all of the facilities
for testing described for the &quot;dns&quot; test are also available for
the &quot;dig&quot; test.
<P>
<DT>dns=hostname<DD>
<DT>dns=TYPE:lookup[,TYPE:lookup...]<DD>
The default DNS tests will attempt a DNS lookup
of the DNS' servers own hostname. You can specify the hostname
to lookup on a DNS server by listing it on each test.
<P>
The second form of the test allows you to perform multiple 
queries of the DNS server, requesting different types of
DNS records. The TYPE defines the type of DNS data: A (IP-address),
MX (Mail eXchanger), PTR (reverse), CNAME (alias), SOA (Start-Of-Authority), 
NS (Name Server) are among the more common ones used. The
&quot;lookup&quot; is the query. E.g. to lookup the MX records for the
&quot;foo.com&quot; domain, you would use &quot;dns=mx:foo.com&quot;. Or to lookup
the nameservers for the &quot;bar.org&quot; domain, &quot;dns=ns:bar.org&quot;. 
You can list multiple lookups, separated by commas. For the
test to end up with a green status, all lookups must succeed.
<P>
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OTHER NETWORK TESTS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>ntp<DD>
Check for a running NTP (Network Time Protocol) server on this
host. This test uses the &quot;ntpdate&quot; utility to check for a
NTP server - you should either have ntpdate in your PATH, or
set the location of the ntpdate program in $XYMONHOME/etc/xymonserver.cfg
<P>
<DT>rpc[=rpcservice1,rpcservice2,...]<DD>
Check for one or more available RPC services. This check is indirect
in that it only queries the RPC Portmapper on the host, not the
actual service. 
<P>
If only &quot;rpc&quot; is given, the test only verifies that the port mapper
is available on the remote host. If you want to check that one or
more RPC services are registered with the port mapper, list the 
names of the desired RPC services after the equals-sign. E.g. for
a working NFS server the &quot;mount&quot;, &quot;nlockmgr&quot; and &quot;nfs&quot; services
must be available; this can be checked with &quot;rpc=mount,nlockmgr,nfs&quot;.
<P>
This test uses the rpcinfo tool for the actual test; if this tool
is not available in the PATH of xymonnet, you must define the
RPCINFO environment variable to point at this tool. See
<I><A HREF="../man5/xymonserver.cfg.5.html">xymonserver.cfg</A>(5)</I>

<P>
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAR">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>HTTP TESTS</H2>

Simple testing of a http URL is done simply by putting the
URL into the hosts.cfg file. Note that this only applies to
URL's that begin with &quot;http:&quot; or &quot;https:&quot;.
<P>
The following items describe more advanced forms of http
URL's.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Basic Authentication with username/password<DD>
If the URL requires authentication in the form of a
username and password, it is most likely using the
HTTP &quot;Basic&quot; authentication. xymonnet support this,
and you can provide the username and password either 
by embedding them in the URL e.g.
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@www.sample.com/">http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@www.sample.com/</A>
<BR>

or by putting the username and password into the ~/.netrc
file (see
<I><A HREF="../man1/ftp.1.html">ftp</A>(1)</I>

for details).
<P>
<DT>Authentication with SSL client certificates<DD>
An SSL client certificate can be used for authentication.
To use this, the client certificate must be stored in a
PEM-formatted file together with the client certificate
key, in the $XYMONHOME/certs/ directory. The URL is then given as
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://CERT:FILENAME@www.sample.com/">http://CERT:FILENAME@www.sample.com/</A>
<BR>

The &quot;CERT:&quot; part is literal - i.e. you write C-E-R-T-colon
and then the filename of the PEM-formatted certificate.
<BR>

A PEM-formatted certificate file can be generated based on
certificates stored in Microsoft Internet Explorer and
OpenSSL. Do as follows:
<BR>

From the MSIE Tools-Options menu, pick the Content tab,
click on Certificates, choose the Personal tab, select the
certificate and click Export. Make sure you export the
private key also. In the Export File Format, choose
PKCS 12 (.PFX), check the &quot;Include all certificates&quot; 
checkbox and uncheck the &quot;Enable strong protection&quot;.
Provide a temporary password for the exported file,
and select a filename for the PFX-file.
<BR>

Now run &quot;openssl pkcs12 -in file.pfx -out file.pem&quot;. When
prompted for the &quot;Import Password&quot;, provide the temporary
password you gave when exporting the certificate. Then
provide a &quot;PEM pass phrase&quot; (twice) when prompted for one.
<BR>

The file.pem file is the one you should use in the FILENAME
field in the URL - this file must be kept in $XYMONHOME/certs/.
The PEM pass phrase must be put into a file named the
same as the certificate, but with extension &quot;.pass&quot;. E.g.
if you have the PEM certificate in $XYMONHOME/certs/client.pem,
you must put the pass phrase into the $XYMONHOME/certs/client.pass
file. Make sure to protect this file with Unix permissions,
so that only the user running Xymon can read it.
<P>
<DT>Forcing an HTTP or SSL version<DD>
Some SSL sites will only allow you to connect, if you use
specific &quot;dialects&quot; of HTTP or SSL. Normally this is auto-negotiated,
but experience shows that this fails on some systems.
<P>
xymonnet can be told to use specific dialects, by adding
one or more &quot;dialect names&quot; to the URL scheme, i.e. the
&quot;http&quot; or &quot;https&quot; in the URL:
<P>
* &quot;2&quot;,  e.g. https2://<A HREF="http://www.sample.com">www.sample.com</A>/ : use only SSLv2
<BR>

* &quot;3&quot;,  e.g. https3://<A HREF="http://www.sample.com">www.sample.com</A>/ : use only SSLv3
<BR>

* &quot;t&quot;,  e.g. <A HREF="httpst://www.sample.com/">httpst://www.sample.com/</A> : use only TLSv1
<BR>

* &quot;m&quot;,  e.g. <A HREF="httpsm://www.sample.com/">httpsm://www.sample.com/</A> : use only 128-bit ciphers
<BR>

* &quot;h&quot;,  e.g. <A HREF="httpsh://www.sample.com/">httpsh://www.sample.com/</A> : use only &gt;128-bit ciphers
<BR>

* &quot;10&quot;, e.g. http10://<A HREF="http://www.sample.com">www.sample.com</A>/ : use HTTP 1.0
<BR>

* &quot;11&quot;, e.g. http11://<A HREF="http://www.sample.com">www.sample.com</A>/ : use HTTP 1.1
<P>
These can be combined where it makes sense, e.g to force
SSLv2 and HTTP 1.0 you would use &quot;https210&quot;.
<P>
<DT>Testing sites by IP-address<DD>
xymonnet ignores the &quot;testip&quot; tag normally used to force a 
test to use the IP-address from the hosts.cfg file instead of
the hostname, when it performs http and https tests.
<P>
The reason for this is that it interacts badly with virtual
hosts, especially if these are IP-based as is common with
https-websites.
<P>
Instead the IP-address to connect to can be overridden by 
specifying it as:
<P>
<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT><A HREF="http://www.sample.com=1.2.3.4/index.html">http://www.sample.com=1.2.3.4/index.html</A><BR>
<P>
The &quot;=1.2.3.4&quot; will case xymonnet to run the test against
the IP-address &quot;1.2.3.4&quot;, but still trying to access a virtual
website with the name &quot;<A HREF="http://www.sample.com">www.sample.com</A>&quot;.
<P>
The &quot;=ip.address.of.host&quot; must be the last part of the hostname,
so if you need to combine this with e.g. an explicit port number,
it should be done as
<P>
<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT><A HREF="http://www.sample.com:3128=1.2.3.4/index.html">http://www.sample.com:3128=1.2.3.4/index.html</A><BR>
<P>
<DT>HTTP Testing via proxy<DD>
<B>NOTE:</B> This is not enabled by default. You must
add the &quot;--bb-proxy-syntax&quot; option when running
<I><A HREF="../man1/xymonnet.1.html">xymonnet</A>(1)</I>

if you want to use this.
<P>
xymonnet supports the Big Brother syntax for
specifying an HTTP proxy to use when performing http 
tests. This syntax just joins the proxy- and the target-URL
into one, e.g.
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://webproxy.sample.com:3128/http://www.foo.com/">http://webproxy.sample.com:3128/http://www.foo.com/</A>
<BR>

would be the syntax for testing the <A HREF="http://www.foo.com">www.foo.com</A> website
via the proxy running on &quot;webproxy.sample.com&quot; port 3128.
<P>
If the proxy port number is not specified, the default 
HTTP port number (80) is used.
<P>
If your proxy requires authentication, you can specify the
username and password inside the proxy-part of the URL, e.g.
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://fred:Wilma1@webproxy.sample.com:3128/http://www.foo.com/">http://fred:Wilma1@webproxy.sample.com:3128/http://www.foo.com/</A>
<BR>

will authenticate to the proxy using a username of &quot;fred&quot; and
a password of &quot;Wilma1&quot;, before requesting the proxy to fetch
the <A HREF="http://www.foo.com">www.foo.com</A> homepage.
<P>
Note that it is not possible to test https-sites via a proxy,
nor is it possible to use https for connecting to the proxy 
itself.
<P>
<DT>cont[=COLUMN];URL;[expected_data_regexp|#digesttype:digest]<DD>
This tag is used to specify a http/https check, where 
it is also checked that specific content is present in
the server response.
<P>
If the URL itself includes a semi-colon, this must be
escaped as '%3B' to avoid confusion over which semicolon
is part of the URL, and which semicolon acts as a delimiter.
<P>
The data that must be returned can be specified either
as a regular expression (except that &lt;space&gt; is not allowed)
or as a message digest (typically using an MD5 sum or 
SHA-1 hash).
<P>
The regex is pre-processed for backslash &quot;\&quot; escape
sequences. So you can really put any character in this
string by escaping it first:
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newline&nbsp;(LF,&nbsp;ASCII&nbsp;10&nbsp;decimal)
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carriage&nbsp;return&nbsp;(CR,&nbsp;ASCII&nbsp;13&nbsp;decimal)
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TAB&nbsp;(ASCII&nbsp;8&nbsp;decimal)
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\\&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Backslash&nbsp;(ASCII&nbsp;92&nbsp;decimal)
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\XX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;character&nbsp;with&nbsp;ASCII&nbsp;hex-value&nbsp;XX
<BR>

<P>
If you must have whitespace in the regex, use the
[[:space:]] syntax, e.g. if you want to test for 
the string &quot;All is OK&quot;, use &quot;All[[:space:]]is[[:space:]]OK&quot;.
Note that this may depend on your particular implementation 
of the regex functions found in your C library. Thanks to 
Charles Goyard for this tip.
<P>
Note: If you are migrating from the &quot;cont2.sh&quot; script,
you must change the '_' used as wildcards by cont2.sh 
into '.' which is the regular-expression wildcard character.
<P>
Message digests can use whatever digest algorithms your
libcrypto implementation (usually OpenSSL) supports. 
Common message digests are &quot;md5&quot;, &quot;sha1&quot;, &quot;sha256&quot; or &quot;sha512&quot;. 
The digest is calculated on the data portion of the response 
from the server, i.e. HTTP headers are not included in the
digest (as they change from one request to the next).
<P>
The expected digest value can be computed with the
<I><A HREF="../man1/xymondigest.1.html">xymondigest</A>(1)</I>

utility.
<P>
&quot;cont&quot; tags in hosts.cfg result in two status reports: One
status with the &quot;http&quot; check, and another with the &quot;content&quot; 
check.
<P>
As with normal URL's, the extended syntax described above
can be used e.g. when testing SSL sites that require the use of 
SSLv2 or strong ciphers.
<P>
The column name for the result of the content check is by default
called &quot;content&quot; - you can change the default with the &quot;--content=NAME&quot;
option to xymonnet. See 
<I><A HREF="../man1/xymonnet.1.html">xymonnet</A>(1)</I>

for a description of this option.
<P>
If more than one content check is present for a host, the first
content check is reported in the column &quot;content&quot;, the second is
reported in the column &quot;content1&quot;, the third in &quot;content2&quot; etc.
<P>
You can also specify the column name directly in the test
specification, by writing it as &quot;cont=COLUMN;<A HREF="http://...">http://...</A>&quot;.
Column-names cannot include whitespace or semi-colon.
<P>
The content-check status by default includes the full URL
that was requested, and the HTML data returned by the server.
You can hide the HTML data on a per-host (not per-test) basis 
by adding the <B>HIDEHTTP</B> tag to the host entry.
<P>
<DT>content=URL<DD>
This syntax is deprecated. You should use the &quot;cont&quot;
tag instead, see above.
<P>
<DT>post[=COLUMN];URL;form-data;[expected_data_regexp|#digesttype:digest]<DD>
This tag can be used to test web pages, that use an input
form. Data can be posted to the form by specifying them 
in the form-data field, and the result can be checked
as if it was a normal content check (see above for a description
of the cont-tag and the restrictions on how the URL must be writen).
<P>
The form-data field must be entered in &quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;
format, which is the most commonly used format for web
forms.
<P>
E.g. if you have a web form defined like this:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;form&nbsp;action=&quot;/cgi-bin/form.cgi&quot;&nbsp;method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;Given&nbsp;name&lt;input&nbsp;type=&quot;text&quot;&nbsp;name=&quot;givenname&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;Surname&lt;input&nbsp;type=&quot;text&quot;&nbsp;name=&quot;surname&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;input&nbsp;type=&quot;submit&quot;&nbsp;value=&quot;Send&quot;&gt;
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/form&gt;
<P>
and you want to post the value &quot;John&quot; to the first field
and &quot;Doe Jr.&quot; to the second field, then the form data field
would be
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;givenname=John&amp;surname=Doe+Jr.
<P>
Note that any spaces in the input value is replaced with '+'.
<P>
If your form-data requires a different content-type, you can specify
it by beginning the form-data with <B>(content-type=TYPE)</B>,
e.g. &quot;(content-type=text/xml)&quot; followed by the POST data. Note
that as with normal forms, the POST data should be specified using
escape-sequences for reserved characters: &quot;space&quot; should be
entered as &quot;\x20&quot;, double quote as &quot;\x22&quot;, newline as &quot;\n&quot;,
carriage-return as &quot;\r&quot;, TAB as &quot;\t&quot;, backslash as &quot;\\&quot;.
Any byte value can be entered using &quot;\xNN&quot; with NN being
the hexadecimal value, e.g. &quot;\x20&quot; is the space character.
<P>
The [expected_data_regexp|#digesttype:digest] is the expected
data returned from the server in response to the POST.
See the &quot;cont;&quot; tag above for details. If you are only interested 
in knowing if it is possible to submit the form (but don't care 
about the data), this can be an empty string - but the ';' at the 
end is required.
<P>
<DT>nocont[=COLUMN];URL;forbidden_data_regexp<DD>
This tag works just like &quot;cont&quot; tag, but reverses the test. 
It is green when the &quot;forbidden_data_regexp&quot; is NOT found in
the response, and red when it IS found. So it can be used to 
watch for data that should NOT be present in the response,
e.g. a server error message.
<P>
<DT>nopost[=COLUMN];URL;form-data;expected_data_regexp<DD>
This tag works just like &quot;post&quot; tag, but reverses the test. 
It is green when the &quot;forbidden_data_regexp&quot; is NOT found in
the response, and red when it IS found. So it can be used to 
watch for data that should NOT be present in the response,
e.g. a server error message.
<P>
<DT>type[=COLUMN];URL;expected_content_type<DD>
This is a variant of the content check - instead of checking
the content data, it checks the type of the data as given by 
the HTTP Content-Type: header. This can used to check if a
URL returns e.g. a PDF file, regardless of what is inside the
PDF file.
<P>
<DT>soap[=COLUMN];URL;SOAPMESSAGE;[expected_data_regexp|#digesttype:digest]<DD>
Send SOAP message over HTTP. This is identical to the &quot;cont&quot;
test, except that the request sent to the server uses a
Content-type of &quot;application/soap+xml&quot;, and it also sends
a &quot;SOAPAction&quot; header with the URL. SOAPMESSAGE is the SOAP
message sent to the server. Since SOAP messages are usually
XML documents, you can store this in a separate file by
specifying &quot;file:FILENAME&quot; as the SOAPMESSAGE parameter.
E.g. a test specification of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;soap=echo;<A HREF="http://soap.foo.bar/baz?wsdl;file:/home/foo/msg.xml;.">http://soap.foo.bar/baz?wsdl;file:/home/foo/msg.xml;.</A>
will read the SOAP message from the file /home/foo/msg.xml
and post it to the URL <A HREF="http://soap.foo.bar/bas?wsdl">http://soap.foo.bar/bas?wsdl</A>
<P>
Note that SOAP XML documents usually must begin with the XML
version line, <B>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt;</B>
<P>
<DT>nosoap[=COLUMN];URL;SOAPMESSAGE;[forbidden_data_regexp|#digesttype:digest]<DD>
This tag works just like &quot;soap&quot; tag, but reverses the test.
It is green when the &quot;forbidden_data_regexp&quot; is NOT found in
the response, and red when it IS found. So it can be used to
watch for data that should NOT be present in the response,
e.g. a server error message.
<P>
<DT>httphead[=COLUMN];URL<DD>
This is used to perform an HTTP HEAD request instead of a GET.
<P>
<DT>httpstatus[=COLUMN];URL;okstatusexpr;notokstatusexpr<DD>
This is used to explicitly test for certain HTTP statuscodes
returned when the URL is requested. The <B>okstatusexpr</B> and
<B>nokokstatusexpr</B> expressions are Perl-compatible regular
expressions, e.g. &quot;2..|302&quot; will match all OK codes and the
redirect (302) status code. If the URL cannot be retrieved,
the status is &quot;999&quot;.
<P>
<DT>HIDEHTTP<DD>
The status display for HTTP checks usually includes the URL,
and for content checks also the actual data from the web page.
If you would like to hide these from view, then the HIDEHTTP
tag will keep this information from showing up on the status
webpages.
<P>
<DT>headermatch<DD>
Content checks by default only search the HTML body returned by
the webserver. This option causes it to also search the HTTP 
headers for the string that must / must not be present.
<P>
<DT>browser=BROWSERNAME<DD>
By default, Xymon sends an HTTP &quot;User-Agent&quot; header identifying
it a &quot;Xymon&quot;. Some websites require that you use a specific
browser, typically Internet Explorer. To cater for testing of
such sites, this tag can be used to modify the data sent in the
User-Agent header.
<BR>

E.g. to perform an HTTP test with Xymon masquerading as an Internet
Explorer 6.0 browser, use <B>browser=&quot;Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0)&quot;</B>.
If you do not know what the User-Agent header should be, open up
the browser that works with this particular site, and open the
URL &quot;javascript:document.writeln(navigator.userAgent)&quot; (just copy this
into the &quot;Open URL&quot; dialog. The text that shows up is what the browser
sends as the User-Agent header.
<P>
<DT>httphdr=STRING<DD>
Xymon can be send additional headers when performing HTTP checks, to
allow for validation of any custom configurations needed for your
site. Note that this is a host-wide configuration. The string will
be added directly to the headers for all URLs on that host. There is
currently no way to have this occur only for specific URLs checked.
<BR>

The string should be encased in quotes, like <B>httphdr=&quot;X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest&quot;</B>.
Newlines can be included, however the string MUST NOT end with a newline
as that may cause premature ending of the headers sent.

<H2>LDAP (DIRECTORY SERVER) TESTS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>ldap<DD>
<DT>ldaps<DD>
Simple check for an LDAP service. This check merely looks for
any service running on the ldap/ldaps service port, but does
not perform any actual LDAP transaction.
<P>
<DT><A HREF="ldap://hostport/dn[?attrs[?scope[?filter[?exts]]]]">ldap://hostport/dn[?attrs[?scope[?filter[?exts]]]]</A><DD>
Check for an LDAP service by performing an LDAP request. This
tag is in the form of an LDAP URI (cf. RFC 2255). This type of
LDAP test requires that
<I><A HREF="../man1/xymonnet.1.html">xymonnet</A>(1)</I>

was built with support for LDAP, e.g. via the OpenLDAP library.
The components of the LDAP URI are:
<PRE>
  <I>hostport</I> is a host name with an optional &quot;:portnumber&quot;
  <I>dn</I> is the search base
  <I>attrs</I> is a comma separated list of attributes to request
  <I>scope</I> is one of these three strings:
    base one sub (default=base)
  <I>filter</I> is filter
  <I>exts</I> are recognized set of LDAP and/or API extensions.
</PRE>

<P>
<DT><A HREF="ldaps://hostport/dn[?attrs[?scope[?filter[?exts]]]]">ldaps://hostport/dn[?attrs[?scope[?filter[?exts]]]]</A><DD>
LDAP service check using LDAPv3 and STARTTLS for talking to
an LDAP server that requires TLS encryption. See
<I><A HREF="../man1/xymonnet.1.html">xymonnet</A>(1)</I>

for a discussion of the different ways of running LDAP servers
with SSL/TLS, and which of these are supported by xymonnet.
<P>
<DT>ldaplogin=username:password<DD>
Define a username and password to use when binding to the LDAP
server for ldap URI tests. If not specified, xymonnet will
attempt an anonymous bind.
<P>
<DT>ldapyellowfail<DD>
Used with an LDAP URL test. If the LDAP query fails during the 
search of the directory, the ldap status is normally reported
as &quot;red&quot; (alarm). This tag reduces a search failure to a 
&quot;yellow&quot; (warning) status.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAT">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PERFORMANCE MONITORING TESTS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>apache[=URL]<DD>
If you are running an Apache web server, adding this tag makes
<I><A HREF="../man1/xymonnet.1.html">xymonnet</A>(1)</I>

collect performance statistics from the Apache web server by
querying the URL <B><A HREF="http://IP.ADDRESS.OF.HOST/server-status?auto">http://IP.ADDRESS.OF.HOST/server-status?auto</A></B>.
The response is sent as a data-report and processed by the Xymon
xymond_rrd module into an RRD file and an &quot;apache&quot; graph. If
your web server requires e.g. authentication, or runs on a different
URL for the server-status, you can provide the full URL needed to 
fetch the server-status page, e.g. 
<B>apache=<A HREF="http://LOGIN:PASSWORD@10.0.0.1/server-status?auto">http://LOGIN:PASSWORD@10.0.0.1/server-status?auto</A></B> 
for a password protected server-status page, or
<B>apache=<A HREF="http://10.0.0.1:8080/apache/server-status?auto">http://10.0.0.1:8080/apache/server-status?auto</A></B> 
for a server listening on port 8080 and with a different path
to the server-status page.
<P>
Note that you need to enable the server-status URL in your
Apache configuration. The following configuration is needed:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Location&nbsp;/server-status&gt;
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SetHandler&nbsp;server-status
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order&nbsp;deny,allow
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;allow&nbsp;from&nbsp;127.0.0.1
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/Location&gt;
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ExtendedStatus&nbsp;On
<P>
Change &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; to the IP-address of the server that runs your
network tests.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAU">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DEFAULT HOST</H2>

If you have certain tags that you want to apply to all hosts, you can
define a host name &quot;.default.&quot; and put the tags on that host. Note that
per-host definitions will override the default ones. To apply to all hosts
this should be listed FIRST in your file.
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> The &quot;.default.&quot; host entry will only accept the following
tags - others are silently ignored: delayyellow, delayred, NOCOLUMNS, 
COMMENT, DESCR, CLASS, dialup, testip, nonongreen, nodisp, noinfo, 
notrends, noclient, TRENDS, NOPROPRED, NOPROPYELLOW, NOPROPPURPLE, NOPROPACK, 
REPORTTIME, WARNPCT, NET, noclear, nosslcert, ssldays, DOWNTIME, depends, 
noping, noconn, trace, notrace, HIDEHTTP, browser, pulldata. Specifically, 
note that network tests, &quot;badTEST&quot; settings, and alternate pageset 
relations cannot be listed on the &quot;.default.&quot; host.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAV">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SENDING SUMMARIES TO REMOTE XYMON SERVERS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>summary ROW.COLUMN IP URL<DD>
If you have multiple Xymon servers, the &quot;summary&quot; directive lets you 
form a hierarchy of servers by sending the overall status of this server
to a remote Xymon server, which then displays this in a special summary
section. E.g. if your offices are spread over three locations, you can 
have a Xymon server at each office. These branch-office Xymon have
a &quot;summary&quot; definition in their hosts.cfg file that makes them report
the overall status of their branch Xymon to the central Xymon server
you maintain at the corporate headquarters.
<P>
Multiple &quot;summary&quot; definitions are allowed.
<P>
The ROW.COLUMN setting defines how this summary is presented on the
server that receives the summary. The ROW text will be used as the
heading for a summary line, and the COLUMN defines the name of the
column where this summary is shown - like the hostname and testname
used in the normal displays. The IP is the IP-address of the <B>remote</B> 
(upstream) Xymon server, where this summary is sent). The URL is the
URL of your <B>local</B> Xymon server.
<P>
The URL need not be that of your Xymon server's main page - it could
be the URL of a sub-page on the local Xymon server. Xymon will report
the summary using the color of the page found at the URL you specify.
E.g. on your corporate Xymon server you want a summary from the
Las Vegas office - but you would like to know both what the overall 
status is, and what is the status of the servers on the critical
Sales department back-office servers in Las Vegas. So you configure
the Las Vegas Xymon server to send <B>two</B> summaries:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;summary&nbsp;Vegas.All&nbsp;10.0.1.1&nbsp;<A HREF="http://vegas.foo.com/xymon/">http://vegas.foo.com/xymon/</A>
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;summary&nbsp;Vegas.Sales&nbsp;10.0.1.1&nbsp;<A HREF="http://vegas.foo.com/xymon/sales/">http://vegas.foo.com/xymon/sales/</A>
<P>
<P>
This gives you one summary line for Baltimore, with two columns: An
&quot;All&quot; column showing the overall status, and a &quot;Sales&quot; column showing
the status of the &quot;sales&quot; page on the Baltimore Xymon server.
<P>
Note: Pages defined using alternate pageset definitions cannot be used,
the URL must point to a web page from the default set of Xymon webpages.
