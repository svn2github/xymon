.TH CGIOPTIONS.CFG 5 "Version 4.2.3:  4 Feb 2009" "Xymon"
.SH NAME
cgioptions.cfg \- Command-line parameters for the Xymon CGI tools

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B $BBHOME/etc/cgioptions.cfg

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I cgioptions.cfg(1)
controls the command-line options passed to all of the Xymon CGI tools
through their respective shell-script wrappers. Typically the options
listed here are used for system-wide configuration of the CGI utilities,
e.g. to define where they read configuration files.

The exact set of command-line options available are described in the
man-page for each of the CGI utilities.

The file is "sourced" into the shell script wrapper, so assignments to
the CGI-specific variables must follow standard shell-script syntax.
