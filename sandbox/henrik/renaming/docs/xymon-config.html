<h1>Configuring Xymon Monitoring</h1>
<p>The Xymon configuration is kept in the files in the <tt>~/server/etc/</tt> 
directory. If you look at this directory, you will see these files:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="manpages/man5/hosts.cfg.5.html">hosts.cfg</a> is the one you will change the most. This file contains
	a list of all the hosts you are monitoring, including information such as their
	IP-address, what network services you are monitoring on the host, what URL's
	you are checking, what subpage in the Xymon web-pages this host is shown on etc.
	The name of the file - "hosts.cfg" - was chosen so it is compatible with the
	Big Brother system which uses the same filename and file format.</li>
	<li><a href="manpages/man5/analysis.cfg.5.html">analysis.cfg</a> is the configuration file for data reported by the Xymon clients installed on the hosts you are monitoring. This defines the color of the cpu-, disk-, memory- and procs-columns, based on the information that is sent to Xymon by the clients.</li>
	<li><a href="manpages/man5/alerts.cfg.5.html">alerts.cfg</a> holds the alerting configuration. In this file,
	you setup the rules for sending out alerts about services going down: Who gets
	the alert, how is it sent, how often, whether to send alerts 24x7 or only between
	10 AM and 4 PM on weekdays etc.</li>
	<li><a href="manpages/man5/xymonserver.cfg.5.html">xymonserver.cfg</a> is the configuration file for the Xymon server.
	This file defines a lot of environment variables that are made available to
	all of the Xymon programs when they run. Some environment variables that are defined
	in the Big Brother system are also setup by Xymon, so that Big Brother extension
	scripts will work.<br>The initial configuration of xymonserver.cfg is setup by the 
	<tt>configure</tt> script when you install Xymon, and in most cases you will 
	not need to change it.</li>
	<li><a href="manpages/man5/tasks.cfg.5.html">tasks.cfg</a> is the configuration file for the <tt>xymonlaunch</tt>
	tool. xymonlaunch is the master program in Xymon, it is the only program you start
	to run the Xymon server. xymonlaunch reads the tasks.cfg file, and starts
	the programs listed here to run the server. Some of the programs may run as daemons,
	some of the programs may run at regular intervals. If you want to use some of the
	advanced options for the <tt>xymongen</tt> or <tt>xymonnet</tt> programs, you change
	the tasks.cfg file to add these options to the command line.</li>
	<li><a href="manpages/man5/graphs.cfg.5.html">graphs.cfg</a> is a configuration file for the <tt>showgraph CGI</tt>.
	It defines how the graphs are generated from the data in the RRD files.</li>
	<li><a href="manpages/man5/protocols.cfg.5.html">protocols.cfg</a> is a configuration file for the <tt>xymonnet</tt> program.
	It defines how network services are checked.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Setting up monitoring of hosts</h1>
<p>The <a href="manpages/man5/hosts.cfg.5.html">hosts.cfg</a> file defines which hosts Xymon monitors. When you install Xymon,
a simple configuration is setup that just lists the Xymon server:<br>
<img src="xymon-bbhosts.png" alt="Simple Xymon hosts.cfg file"></p>

<p>There are a few things to notice here:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Lines that begin with a <em>&#35;</em> are comments.</li>
	<li>Each host you monitor is on a line by itself, with the IP-address
	and the hostname of the host.</li>
	<li>You can add extra tags to each host definition, by putting in a
	&#35;-mark and then some keywords. These keywords define how Xymon
	handles the host.</li>
</ul>
<p>The hosts.cfg file shown in the example has only one host defined: 
<em>www.hswn.dk</em> which is the server running Xymon. There are a few
extra keywords thrown in:</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>BBDISPLAY, BBPAGER, BBNET</em> are compatibility settings 
	for extensions written for Big Brother. Xymon doesn't use these,
	but puts them in the hosts.cfg file to avoid problems if you mix 
	Xymon and Big Brother modules.</li>
	<li><em>bbd</em> is the name of a <i>network test</i>. This keyword
	causes the Xymon network-tester <tt>xymonnet</tt> to check if 
	the bbd network service is running on this host, and send a status
	report to the Xymon server with the information about this service.
	So you'll get a (hopefully!) green icon on the Xymon webpage for
	this host, showing the status of the bbd network service.<br>
	Network services are defined in the <em>protocols.cfg</em> file, so
	this file must have an entry for <tt>bbd</tt> defining what TCP
	port to check, and possibly also what data to send to the service and
	what to expect as a response.</li>
	<li><em>http://www.hswn.dk/</em> is a URL, obviously. This also
	triggers a network test, the Xymon network tester will try to request
	this URL, and send in a status report showing if the URL was accessible
	or not.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, Xymon will always check if the host is up and running by trying to
&quot;ping&quot; it. This results in a <em>conn</em> column on the Xymon webpage
for this host, showing if the ping-test succeeded. If you have a host that does
not respond to ping - e.g. because there is a firewall that filters out such
requests - then you can disable the ping-test by putting a "noconn" keyword on 
the line in hosts.cfg.</p>

<p>As you can see, the syntax is pretty straight-forward. Need to monitor an extra 
URL for this server ? Just add the URL to the line. Need to check if ssh (Secure Shell)
is running ? Just add <em>ssh</em> to the line. The full set of keywords you can
use is described in the <a href="manpages/man5/hosts.cfg.5.html">hosts.cfg man-page</a>.
Many of the keywords relate to the
way Xymon displays the information about the host on the web-pages, other keywords
deal with how the uptime percentage is calculated for availability reports, and
some keywords - like the <em>bbd</em> and <em>http://...</em> mentioned above -
describe the network services that are tested for this host.</p>

<h3>Monitoring network services</h3>
<p>As shown in the example above, adding a network test for a host is as simple as
putting the right keyword into the hosts.cfg file. The default set of network tests
configured in Xymon 4.0 is as follows:</p>
<table align="center" width="80%" summary="Network test keywords">
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">conn</th><td>Simple ping test. Enabled by default, you can disable it by putting "noconn" into hosts.cfg.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">http</th><td>Web-server test. Enter the URL to request from the webserver.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">ftp</th><td>FTP server test.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">ssh</th><td>SSH (Secure Shell) server test. Supports ssh1 and ssh2.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">telnet</th><td>Telnet server test.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">smtp</th><td>SMTP (Mail server) test.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">pop3</th><td>POP-3 test.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">imap</th><td>IMAP test. IMAP version 2 and 4 are supported, for version 3 use "imap3".</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">nntp</th><td>NNTP (News) server test.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">ldap</th><td>LDAP (Directory server) test. Enter the full LDAP URI if Xymon is configured with LDAP support.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">rsync</th><td>rsync server test</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">bbd</th><td>Big Brother daemon test. Also works with the Xymon network daemon.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">clamd</th><td>CLAM anti-virus daemon test.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">spamd</th><td>SpamAssassin anti-spam daemon test.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">oratns</th><td>Oracle TNS listener test. Will attempt to do an oratns "ping".</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">qmtp</th><td>QMTP server test. For qmail's qmtpd service.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">qmqp</th><td>QMQP server test. For qmail's qmqpd service.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>If Xymon is built with OpenSSL support, the following SSL-enabled services can also be checked:</p>
<table align="center" width="80%" summary="SSL network tests">
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">https</th><td>Web-server test. Enter the URL to request from the webserver.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">ftps</th><td>Secure FTP server test.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">telnets</th><td>Secure Telnet server test.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">smtps</th><td>Secure SMTP server test.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">pop3s</th><td>Secure POP-3 server test.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">imaps</th><td>Secure IMAP server test.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">nntps</th><td>Secure NNTP (News) server test.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">ldaps</th><td>Secure LDAP (Directory) server test. Enter the full LDAP URI if Xymon is configured with LDAP support. Note that this is only possible when Xymon is built with the OpenLDAP v2.x client library, and only for LDAP servers that support LDAP version 3 and the "starttls" command. LDAP server that use the older non-standard method of tunnelling LDAP through SSL on port 636 will not work.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>There are a few network tests that Xymon can run for you, by using external programs. This is not a very effective way of testing, so it is only done this way for a few very specialised tests:</p>
<table align="center" width="80%" summary="Network tests using external programs">
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">ntp</th><td>NTP (Network Time protocol) server test, using the "ntpdate" command.</td></tr>
	<tr><th align="left" valign="top">rpc</th><td>RPC service test. This queries the <em>portmapper</em> service on the server, using the "rpcinfo" command. See the <b>hosts.cfg(5)</b> man-page for details on how to test for specific RPC services.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Monitoring host-specific data with clients</h3>
<p>You can install a client on each of the hosts you monitor, to check 
host-specific data such as CPU utilisation, disk usage, if certain processes 
and services are running etc. Xymon includes clients for most Unix-like
operating systems. A client for Windows is planned but the programming
has not yet started.</p>

<p>First, make sure you have installed the Xymon client on all of the
hosts you want to monitor, and you have these hosts listed in your 
hosts.cfg file. The Xymon client will pick up the hostname of the box
it is running on automatically, but it is not uncommon for the name
it finds to be different from what you've put into hosts.cfg. So if
you know that the client is running but no data appears, check that
the hostname used by the Xymon client is the one you expect. See
<a href="xymon-tips.html#noclient">this FAQ item</a> for details.</p>

<p>With the Xymon client running and reporting data into Xymon, you
should see the cpu-, disk-, memory- and procs-columns appear. The color
of these status columns is determined by settings in the 
<a href="manpages/man5/analysis.cfg.5.html"> analysis.cfg</a>
configuration file. Here is an example of how to setup a host:</p>
<p><img src="xymon-clients.png"></p>

<p>As you can see, there's first a definition of what hosts the
following criteria applies to. Here, it is only a single host:
voodoo.hswn.dk - but you can use various filters on hostnames,
pagenames and time of day to determine what the thresholds should
be for each of the criteria monitored with the client data.
The <a href="manpages/man5/analysis.cfg.5.html">analysis.cfg</a>
man-page describes this in detail.</p>
<p>After the host filter comes the criteria used to determine the
color of each of the status columns.</p>
<table align="center" width="80%" summary="Client configuration critera">
	<tr>
		<th align="left" valign="top">UP</th>
		<td>Sets the <b>cpu</b> column color, based on how long the host 
			has been up. After the UP keyword you put two time limits:
			The first one (30m in the example) defines how long after a
			reboot the cpu column is yellow. The second (optional)
			value causes the cpu column to go yellow after the host
			has been up for this long - it may be useful, if you need
			to reboot your servers regularly.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th align="left" valign="top">LOAD</th>
		<td>Sets the <b>cpu</b> column color, based on how much load is
			on the system.
			After the LOAD keyword you put two limits: The first number
			is the limit where the cpu column goes yellow; the second
			is the limit where the cpu column goes red.<br>
			For Unix systems, this threshold is matched against the
			5-minute load average value, as reported by the "uptime"
			command - it is therefore a positive number.<br>
			For Windows systems, this threshold is matched against
			the CPU utilisation - this is a percentage between 0
			and 100.<br>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th align="left" valign="top">DISK</th>
		<td>Sets the <b>disk</b> column color based on how full the filesystem
			is. This takes three parameters: The name of the filesystems;
			the threshold where it goes yellow; and the thresholds where it
			goes red.<br>
			The name of the filesystem is the mount point. You can specify
			this either with the full path, or you can use <b>*</b> meaning
			&quot;all filesystems&quot;. You can also use regular expressions
			by prefixing the expression with a percent sign, e.g. &quot;%^/ora.*&quot;
			would match all filesystems that are mounted on a path beginning with
			&quot;/ora&quot; - &quot;/ora/db/vol1&quot; for instance. As shown
			in the example, you can have multiple specifications with different
			thresholds - these are evaluated from top to bottom, so it is best
			to put the most specific ones first, and the general ones last.<br>
			The yellow and red thresholds are percentages - they trigger when
			the filesystem has filled up to the percentage you specify.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th align="left" valign="top">PROC</th>
		<td>Sets the <b>procs</b> column color based on what processes are running.
			This takes at least one parameter: A string that is (part of) the 
			command line that the process runs. You can have a simple string here
			or a regular expression - Xymon will scan the &quot;ps&quot; output
			for the string or expression, and count how many times it appeared
			in the ps listing.<br>
			The process count is then matched against the thresholds that are
			the second and third parameter - the second parameter is the minimum
			count (by default: 1), and the third parameter is the maximum count
			(default: -1, meaning unlimited). Note: If you want to set a maximum
			count, then you must also set a minimum count - even if it is 1.<br>
			The last parameter defines the color used for the procs column, if
			the process count does not fall within the thresholds. By default it
			will go red - you can put &quot;yellow&quot; as the last parameter.<br>
			You can have several PROC entries for the same host, if you need to
			monitor multiple processes.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th align="left" valign="top">MEMPHYS<br>MEMACT<br>MEMSWAP</th>
		<td>Set the <b>memory</b> column color based on the thresholds for memory
			utilisation. Each of these keywords takes two parameters: The first
			is the warning (yellow) threshold - in percent - of memory used. 
			The second is the panic (red) threshold - in percent - of memory 
			used.<br>
			By using one of the three keywords, you can set thresholds for the
			physical memory (RAM), the swap space, and - on platforms supporting
			this, e.g. Linux - the actual amount of memory used for applications.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th align="left" valign="top">LOG</th>
		<td>Set the <b>msgs</b> column color. This takes at least two parameters:
			The first is the name of the logfile, the second is a pattern
			defining which logentries trigger a change of color.<br>
			Optionally, this can be followed by a third parameter defining
			which color this LOG entry causes, and fourth parameter which
			is an "ignore" pattern you can use to filter out lines which
			do match the first pattern of lines that trigger a change in
			color, but that you really do not want to trigger a color change.<br>
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<h3>More about logfile monitoring</h3>
<p>Configuring the LOG entries in the analysis.cfg file is only one half of
the configuration - you also need to tell the Xymon client running on the 
monitored system that it must send in some data from that logfile in the
first place. For that, you must configure the
<a href="manpages/man5/client-local.cfg.5.html"> client-local.cfg</a> file
with the name of the logfile.</p>
