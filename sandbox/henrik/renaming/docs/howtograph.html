<h1>How to setup custom graphs</h1>
This document walks you through the setup of custom graphs in
your Xymon installation. Although Xymon comes with pre-defined
setups for a lot of common types of graphs, it is also extensible
allowing you to add your own tests. For many kinds of tests, it
is nice to view them over a period of time in a graph - this 
document tells you how to do that.

<h2>Make a script to collect the data</h2>
<p>First create your test data. Typically, this is an extension
script that sends in some data to Xymon, using a <b>status</b> or
<b>data</b> command. If you use <b>status</b>, it will show up as a 
separate column on the display, with a green/yellow/red color
that can trigger alerts. If you use <b>data</b>, Xymon just collects
the data into a graph - you must go to the <b>trends</b> column to
see the graph. For this example, we'll use <b>status</b>.</p>

<p>So we create an extension script. Here is an example script; 
it picks two numbers out of the Linux kernel's memory statistics,
and reports these to Xymon.

<pre><tt>
	#!/bin/sh

	cat /proc/slabinfo | \
	   egrep "^dentry_cache|^inode_cache" | \
	      awk '{print $1 " : " $3*$4}' &gt;/tmp/slab.txt

	$BB $BBDISP "status $MACHINE.slab green `date`

	`cat /tmp/slab.txt`
	"

	exit 0
</tt></pre>

<h2>Get xymonlaunch to run the script</h2>
<p>Save this script in ~xymon/client/ext/slab, and add a section to
the ~xymon/client/etc/clientlaunch.cfg to run it every 5 minutes:

<pre><tt>
	[slabinfo]
        	ENVFILE /usr/lib/xymon/client/etc/xymonclient.cfg
	        CMD /usr/lib/xymon/client/ext/slab
		INTERVAL 5m
</tt></pre>
(On the Xymon server itself, you must add this to the file 
~xymon/server/etc/tasks.cfg)


<h2>Check that the script data arrives in Xymon</h2>
<p>After a few minutes, a <b>slab</b> column should appear on your Xymon view
of this host, with the data it reports. The output looks like this:

<pre><tt>
	Sun Nov 20 09:03:44 CET 2005

	inode_cache : 330624
	dentry_cache : 40891068
</tt></pre>

<h2>Arrange for the data to be collected into an RRD file</h2>
<p>This is obviously a name-colon-value formatted report, so we'll use the
NCV module in Xymon to handle it. Xymon will find two datasets here:
The first will be called <b>inodecache</b>, and the second <b>dentrycache</b>
(note that Xymon strips off any part of the name that is not a letter
or a number; Xymon also limits the length of the dataset name to 19 
letters max. since RRD will not handle longer names).

To enable this, on the Xymon server edit the ~xymon/server/etc/xymonserver.cfg
file. The TEST2RRD setting defines how Xymon tests (status columns) map to RRD 
datafiles. So you add the new test to this setting, by adding <b>slab=ncv</b> at the
end:

<pre><tt>
TEST2RRD=&quot;cpu=la,disk,&lt;...lots more stuff...&gt;,hobbitd,mysql=ncv,slab=ncv&quot;
</tt></pre>

<p><b>slab</b> is the status column name, and <b>=ncv</b> is a token that tells Xymon
to send these data through the built-in NCV module.</p>

<p>By default, the Xymon NCV module expects data to be some sort of counter,
e.g. number of bytes sent over a network - it uses the RRD <b>DERIVE</b> datatype
by default, which is for data that is continuously increasing in value. 
Some data are not like that - the data in our test script is not - and for
those data you'll have to make an extra setting to tell Xymon what RRD data
type to use.  The RRDtool rrdcreate(1) man-page has a detailed description 
of the various RRD datatypes. It is available online at 
<a href="http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/rrdtool/doc/rrdcreate.en.html">
	http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/rrdtool/doc/rrdcreate.en.html</a></p>

<p>Our test script provides data that goes up and down in value
(it is the number of bytes of memory used for a Linux kernel bufffer), and
for that kind of data we'll use the RRD <b>GAUGE</b> datatype. So we add an extra
setting to xymonserver.cfg:</p>

<pre><tt>
	NCV_slab=&quot;inodecache:GAUGE,dentrycache:GAUGE&quot;
</tt></pre>

<p>This tells the xymond_rrd module that it should create an RRD file with
two datasets of type GAUGE instead of the default (DERIVE). The setting must
be named NCV_&lt;columnname&gt;.</p>

<p>The xymonserver.cfg file is not reloaded automatically, so you must restart
Xymon after making these changes. Or at least, kill the xymond_rrd processes
(there are usually two) - xymonlaunch will automatically restart them, and
they will then pick up the new settings.</p>

<h2>Check that the RRD collects data</h2>
<p>The next time the <b>slab</b> status is updated, Xymon will begin to collect
the data. You can check this by looking for the <b>slab.rrd</b> file in the
~xymon/data/rrd/HOSTNAME/ directory. If you want to check the data it
collects, the <b>rrdtool dump ~xymon/data/rrd/HOSTNAME/slab.rrd</b> will 
tell you what it got:

<pre><tt>
	&lt;!-- Round Robin Database Dump --&gt;
	&lt;rrd&gt;
		&lt;version&gt; 0001 &lt;/version&gt;
		&lt;step&gt; 300 &lt;/step&gt; &lt;!-- Seconds --&gt;
		&lt;lastupdate&gt; 1132474725 &lt;/lastupdate&gt; &lt;!-- 2005-11-20 09:18:45 CET --&gt;

		&lt;ds&gt;
			&lt;name&gt; inodecache &lt;/name&gt;
RRD datatype------&gt;	&lt;type&gt; GAUGE &lt;/type&gt;
			&lt;minimal_heartbeat&gt; 600 &lt;/minimal_heartbeat&gt;
			&lt;min&gt; 0.0000000000e+00 &lt;/min&gt;
			&lt;max&gt; NaN &lt;/max&gt;

			&lt;!-- PDP Status --&gt;
current value-----&gt;	&lt;last_ds&gt; 330624 &lt;/last_ds&gt;
			&lt;value&gt; 0.0000000000e+00 &lt;/value&gt;
			&lt;unknown_sec&gt; 0 &lt;/unknown_sec&gt;
		&lt;/ds&gt;
</tt></pre>

<p>If you go and look at the status page for the <b>slab</b> column, you should
not see any graph yet, but a link to <b>xymon graph ncv:slab</b>. One final
step is missing.</p>


<h2>Setup a graph definition</h2>
<p>The final step is to tell Xymon how to create a graph from the data 
in the RRD file. This is done in the ~xymon/server/etc/graphs.cfg
file.

<pre><tt>
	[slab]
		TITLE Slab info
		YAXIS Bytes
		DEF:inode=slab.rrd:inodecache:AVERAGE
		DEF:dentry=slab.rrd:dentrycache:AVERAGE
		LINE2:inode#00CCCC:Inode cache
		LINE2:dentry#FF0000:Dentry cache
		COMMENT:\n
		GPRINT:inode:LAST:Inode cache \: %5.1lf%s (cur)
		GPRINT:inode:MAX: \: %5.1lf%s (max)
		GPRINT:inode:MIN: \: %5.1lf%s (min)
		GPRINT:inode:AVERAGE: \: %5.1lf%s (avg)\n
		GPRINT:dentry:LAST:Dentry cache\: %5.1lf%s (cur)
		GPRINT:dentry:MAX: \: %5.1lf%s (max)
		GPRINT:dentry:MIN: \: %5.1lf%s (min)
		GPRINT:dentry:AVERAGE: \: %5.1lf%s (avg)\n
</tt></pre>

<p><b>[slab]</b> is the name of this graph, and it must match the name of your 
status column if you want the graph to appear together with the status.
The TITLE and YAXIS settings define the graph title and the legend on
the Y-axis. The rest are definitions for the rrdgraph(1) tool - you should
read the RRDtool docs if you want to know in detail how it works.
For now, all you need to know is that you must pick out the data you 
want from the RRD file with a <b>DEF</b> line, like
<pre><tt>
		DEF:inode=slab.rrd:inodecache:AVERAGE
</tt></pre>
which gives you an "inode" definition that has the value from the
<b>inodecache</b> dataset in the slab.rrd file. This is then used to draw
a line on the graph:
<pre><tt>
		LINE2:inode#00CCCC:Inode cache
</tt></pre>
The line gets the color <b>#00CCCC</b> (red-green-blue), which is a light 
greenish-blue color. Note that you can have several lines in one graph,
if it makes sense to compare them. You can also use other types of
visual effects, e.g. stack values on top of each other (like the <b>vmstat</b>
graphs do) - this is described in the rrdgraph man-page. An online version
is at <a href="http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/rrdtool/doc/rrdgraph.en.html">
	http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/rrdtool/doc/rrdgraph.en.html</a>.</p>

<p>The GPRINT lines at the end of the graph definition also uses the <b>inode</b>
value to print a summary line showing the current, maximum, minimum and 
average values from the data that has been collected.</p>

<p>Once you have added this section to graphs.cfg, refresh the
status page in your browser, and the graph should show up.</p>


<h2>Add the graph to the collection of graphs on the trends column</h2>
<p>If you want the graph included with the other graphs on the <b>trends</b>
column, you must add it to the GRAPHS setting in the
~xymon/server/etc/xymonserver.cfg file.</p>

<pre><tt>
	GRAPHS=&quot;la,disk,&lt;... lots more ...&gt;,bbproxy,hobbitd,slab&quot;
</tt></pre>
Save the file, and when you click on the <b>trends</b> column you should
see the slab graph at the bottom of the page.


<h2>Common problems and pitfalls</h2>
<h3>If your graph nearly always shows 0</h3>
<p>You probably used the wrong RRD datatype for your data - see step 4.
By default, the RRD file expects data that is increasing constantly;
if you are tracking some data that just varies up and down, you must
use the RRD GAUGE datatype. Note that when you change the RRD datatype,
you must delete any existing RRD files - the RRD datatype is defined
when the RRD file is created, and cannot be changed on the fly.</p>

<h3>No graph on the status page, but OK on the trends page</h3>
<p>Make sure you have <b>ncv</b> listed in the GRAPHS setting in xymonserver.cfg. 
(Don't ask why - just take my word that it must be there).</p>
