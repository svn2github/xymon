bbhostgrep - pick out lines in bb-hosts

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>bbhostgrep --help</B>

<BR>

<B>bbhostgrep --version</B>

<BR>

<B>bbhostgrep [--noextras] [--test-untagged] [--bbdisp] [--bbnet] TAG [TAG...]</B>

<P>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<I><A HREF="../man1/bbhostgrep.1.html">bbhostgrep</A>(1)</I>

is for use by extension scripts that need to pick out the entries 
in a bb-hosts file that are relevant to the script.
<P>
The utility accepts test names as parameters, and will then
parse the bb-hosts file and print out the host entries that
have at least one of the wanted tests specified. Tags may be
given with a trailing asterisk '*', e.g. &quot;bbhostgrep http*&quot;
is needed to find all http and https tags.
<P>
The bbhostgrep utility supports the use of &quot;include&quot; directives
inside the bb-hosts file, and will find matching tags in all
included files.
<P>
If the DOWNTIME or SLA tags are used in the
<I><A HREF="../man5/bb-hosts.5.html">bb-hosts</A>(5)</I>

file, these are interpreted relative to the current time. 
bbhostgrep then outputs a &quot;INSIDESLA&quot; or &quot;OUTSIDESLA&quot; tag
for easier use by scripts that want to check if the current
time is inside or outside the expected uptime window.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>--noextras<DD>
Remove the &quot;testip&quot;, &quot;dialup&quot;, &quot;INSIDESLA&quot; and &quot;OUTSIDESLA&quot; tags 
from the output.
<P>
<DT>--test-untagged<DD>
When using the BBLOCATION environment variable to test
only hosts on a particular network segment, bbtest-net
will ignore hosts that do not have any &quot;NET:x&quot; tag.
So only hosts that have a NET:$BBLOCATION tag will be
tested.
<BR>

With this option, hosts with no NET: tag are included
in the test, so that all hosts that either have a
matching NET: tag, or no NET: tag at all are tested.
<P>
<DT>--no-down[=TESTNAME]<DD>
bbhostgrep will query the Hobbit server for the current
status of the &quot;conn&quot; test, and if TESTNAME is specified
also for the current state of the specified test. If
the status of the &quot;conn&quot; test for a host is non-green,
or the status of the TESTNAME test is disabled, then this 
host is ignored and will not be included in the output.
This can be used to ignore hosts that are down, or hosts
where the custom test is disabled.
<P>
<DT>--bbdisp<DD>
Search the bb-hosts file following include statements as a
BBDISPLAY server would.
<P>
<DT>--bbnet<DD>
Search the bb-hosts file following include statements as a
BBNET server would.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLE</H2>

If your bb-hosts file looks like this
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;192.168.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.test.com">www.test.com</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;#&nbsp;ftp&nbsp;telnet&nbsp;!oracle
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;192.168.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;db1.test.com&nbsp;&nbsp;#&nbsp;oracle
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;192.168.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mail.test.com&nbsp;#&nbsp;smtp
<P>
and you have a custom Hobbit extension script that performs the
&quot;oracle&quot; test, then running &quot;bbhostgrep oracle&quot; would yield
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;192.168.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.test.com">www.test.com</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;#&nbsp;!oracle
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;192.168.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;db1.test.com&nbsp;&nbsp;#&nbsp;oracle
<P>
so the script can quickly find the hosts that are of interest.
<P>
Note that the reverse-test modifier - &quot;!oracle&quot; - is included
in the output; this also applies to the other test modifiers
defined by Hobbit (the dialup and always-true modifiers).
<P>
If your extension scripts use more than one tag, just list
all of the interesting tags on the command line.
<P>
bbhostgrep also supports the &quot;NET:location&quot; tag used by 
bbtest-net, so if your script performs network checks then 
it will see only the hosts that are relevant for the test
location that the script currently executes on.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>USE IN EXTENSION SCRIPTS</H2>

To integrate bbhostgrep into an existing script, look for
the line in the script that grep's in the $BBHOSTS file. 
Typically it will look somewhat like this:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$GREP&nbsp;-i&nbsp;&quot;^[0-9].*#.*TESTNAME&quot;&nbsp;$BBHOSTS&nbsp;|&nbsp;...&nbsp;code&nbsp;to&nbsp;handle&nbsp;test
<P>
Instead of the grep, we will use bbhostgrep. It then becomes
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$BBHOME/bin/bbhostgrep&nbsp;TESTNAME&nbsp;|&nbsp;...&nbsp;code&nbsp;to&nbsp;handle&nbsp;test
<P>
which is simpler, less error-prone and more efficient.

a matching NET:$BBLOCATION setting.
