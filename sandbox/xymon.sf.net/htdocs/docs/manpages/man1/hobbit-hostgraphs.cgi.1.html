hobbit-hostgraphs.cgi - CGI program to show multiple graphs
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>hobbit-hostgraph.cgi</B>

<P>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>hobbit-hostgraph.cgi</B>
is invoked as a CGI script via the hobbit-hostgraph.sh CGI wrapper.
<P>
If no parameters are provided when invoked, it will present a form
where the user can select a time period, one or more hosts, and a
set of graphs.
<P>
The parameters selected by the user are passed to a second invocation
of hobbit-hostgraph.cgi, and result in a webpage showing a list of
graph images based on the trend data stored about the hosts.
<P>
If multiple graph-types are selected, hobbit-hostgraph.cgi will display
a list of graphs, with one graph per type.
<P>
If multiple hosts are selected, hobbit-hostgraph.cgi will attempt to
display a multi-host graph for each type where the graphs for all
hosts are overlayed in a single image, allowing for easy comparison
of the hosts.
<P>
The hostlist uses the PAGEPATH cookie provided by Hobbit webpages to
select the list of hosts to present. Only the hosts visible on the
page where hobbit-hostgraph.cgi is invoked from will be visible.
<P>
The resulting graph page can be bookmarked, but the bookmark
also fixates the time period shown.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>--env=FILENAME<DD>
Loads the environment defined in FILENAME before executing the CGI script.

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

This utility is experimental. It may change in a future release of Hobbit.
<P>
It is possible for the user to select graphs which do not exist. This results
in broken image links.
<P>
The set of graph-types is fixed in the server/web/hostgraphs_form template 
and does not adjust to which graphs are available.
<P>
If the tool is invoked directly, all hosts defined in Hobbit will be listed.
