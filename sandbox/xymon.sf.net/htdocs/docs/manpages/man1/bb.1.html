bb - Hobbit client communication program
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>bb [options] RECIPIENT message</B>

<P>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<I><A HREF="../man1/bb.1.html">bb</A>(1)</I>

is the client program used to communicate with a
Hobbit server. It is frequently used by Hobbit
client systems to send in status messages and pager
alerts on local tests.
<P>
In Hobbit, the bb program is also used for administrative
purposes, e.g. to rename or delete hosts, or to disable
hosts that are down for longer periods of time.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS AND PARAMETERS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>--debug<DD>
Enable debugging. This prints out details about how the
connection to the BBDISPLAY server is being established.
<P>
<DT>--proxy=<A HREF="http://PROXYSERVER:PROXYPORT/">http://PROXYSERVER:PROXYPORT/</A><DD>
When sending the status messages via HTTP, use this server
as an HTTP proxy instead of connecting directly to the BBDISPLAY
server.
<P>
<DT>--timeout=N<DD>
Specifies the timeout for connecting to the Hobbit server, in
seconds. The default is 5 seconds.
<P>
<DT>RECIPIENT<DD>
The <B>RECIPIENT</B> parameter defines which server receives
the message. If RECIPIENT is given as &quot;0.0.0.0&quot;, then the
message is sent to all of the servers listed in the BBDISPLAYS
or BBPAGERS environment variable (for &quot;status&quot; and &quot;page&quot; messages,
respectively). 
<P>
Usually, a client will use &quot;$BBDISP&quot; for the <B>RECIPIENT</B> 
parameter, as this is defined for the client scripts
to automatically contain the correct value.
<P>
The <B>RECIPIENT</B> parameter may be a URL for a webserver
that has the bbmessage.cgi or similar script installed. This
tunnels the Hobbit messages to the BBDISPLAY server 
using standard HTTP protocol. The 
<I><A HREF="../man8/bbmessage.cgi.8.html">bbmessage.cgi</A>(8)</I>

CGI tool (included in Hobbit) must be installed on the webserver 
for the HTTP transport to work.
<BR>

<P>
<DT>MESSAGE<DD>
The <B>message</B> parameter is the message to be sent across
to the Hobbit server. Messages must be enclosed in quotes,
but by doing so they can span multiple lines. The maximum size
of a message is defined by the maximum allowed length of your
shell's commandline, and is typically 8-32 KB. 
<P>
If you need to send longer status messages, you can specify &quot;@&quot; 
as the message: bb will then read the status message from its
stdin.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>HOBBIT MESSAGE SYNTAX</H2>

<P>
This section lists the most commonly used messages in the Hobbit
protocol.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>status[+LIFETIME][/group:GROUP] HOSTNAME.TESTNAME COLOR &lt;additional text&gt;<DD>
This sends in a status message for a single test (column) on a single host.
TESTNAME is the name of the column where this test will show up; any
name is valid except that using dots in the testname will not work.
COLOR must be one of the valid colors: &quot;green&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;red&quot; or &quot;clear&quot;.
The colors &quot;blue&quot; and &quot;purple&quot; - although valid colors - should not be sent in a
status-message, as these are handled specially by the Hobbit server.
<BR>

The &quot;additional text&quot; normally includes a local timestamp and a summary
of the test result on the first line. Any lines following the first one
are free-form, and can include any information that may be useful to
diagnose the problem being reported.
<BR>

The LIFETIME defines how long this status is valid after being received
by the Hobbit server. The default is 30 minutes, but you can set any
period you like. E.g. for a custom test that runs once an hour, you will
want to set this to at least 60 minutes - otherwise the status will go
purple after 30 minutes. It is a good idea to set the LIFETIME to
sligtly more than the interval between your tests, to allow for variations
in the time it takes your test to complete. The LIFETIME is in minutes,
unless you add an &quot;h&quot; (hours), &quot;d&quot; (days) or &quot;w&quot; (weeks) immediately after
the number, e.g. &quot;status+5h&quot; for a status that is valid for 5 hours.
<BR>

The GROUP option is used to direct alerts from the status to a specific group.
It is currently used for status generated from the Hobbit clients' data,
e.g. to direct alerts for a &quot;procs&quot; status to different people, depending on
exactly which process is down.
<P>
<DT>notify HOSTNAME.TESTNAME &lt;message text&gt;<DD>
This triggers an informational message to be sent to those who 
receive alerts for this HOSTNAME+TESTNAME combination, 
according to the rules defined in
<I><A HREF="../man5/hobbit-alerts.cfg.5.html">hobbit-alerts.cfg</A>(5)</I>

This is used by the 
<I><A HREF="../man1/hobbit-enadis.cgi.1.html">hobbit-enadis.cgi</A>(1)</I>

tool to notify people about hosts being disabled or 
enabled, but can also serve as a general way of notifying 
server administrators.
<P>
<DT>data HOSTNAME.DATANAME&lt;newline&gt;&lt;additional text&gt;<DD>
The &quot;data&quot; message allows tools to send data about a host, without
it appearing as a column on the Hobbit webpages. This
is used e.g. to report statistics about a host, e.g. vmstat data which
does not in itself represent something that has a red, yellow or
green identity. It is used by RRD bottom-feeder modules, among
others. In Hobbit, data messages are by default processed only by the
<I><A HREF="../man8/hobbitd_rrd.8.html">hobbitd_rrd</A>(8)</I>

module. If you want to handle data-messages by an external application,
you may want to enable the 
<I><A HREF="../man8/hobbitd_filestore.8.html">hobbitd_filestore</A>(8)</I>

module for data-messages, to store data-messages in a format compatible
with how the Big Brother daemon does.
<P>
<DT>disable HOSTNAME.TESTNAME DURATION &lt;additional text&gt;<DD>
Disables a specific test for DURATION minutes. This will cause the
status of this test to be listed as &quot;blue&quot; on the BBDISPLAY server,
and no alerts for this host/test will be generated. If DURATION is
given as a number followed by s/m/h/d, it is interpreted as being
in seconds/minutes/hours/days respectively.
<B>To</B>disable<B>all</B>tests<B>for</B>a<B>host,</B>use<B>an</B>asterisk<B>*</B>for<B>TESTNAME.</B>

<P>
<DT>enable HOSTNAME.TESTNAME<DD>
Re-enables a test that had been disabled.
<P>
<DT>query HOSTNAME.TESTNAME<DD>
Query the BBDISPLAY server for the latest status reported for this
particular test. If the host/test status is known, the response is
the first line of the status report - the current color will be the
first word on the line. Additional lines of text that might be 
present on the status-message cannot be retrieved.
<BR>

This allows any Hobbit client to determine the status of a particular
test, whether it is one pertaining to the host where the client
is running, some other host, or perhaps the result of a combined
test from multiple hosts managed by
<I><A HREF="../man1/bbcombotest.1.html">bbcombotest</A>(1)</I>

This will typically be useful to Hobbit client extension scripts, that
need to determine the status of other hosts e.g. to decide if an
automatic recovery action should be initiated.
<P>
<DT>config FILENAME<DD>
Retrieve one of the Hobbit configuration files from the
server. This command allows a client to pull files from the
$BBHOME/etc/ directory on the server, allowing for semi-automatic
updates of the client configuration. Since the configuration files 
are designed to have a common file for the configuration of all hosts 
in the system - and this is in fact the recommended way of configuring 
your clients - this makes it easier to keep the configuration 
files synchronized.
<P>
<DT>drop HOSTNAME<DD>
Removes all data stored about the host HOSTNAME. It is assumed that you
have already deleted the host from the bb-hosts configuration file.
<P>
<DT>drop HOSTNAME TESTNAME<DD>
Remove data about a single test (column).
<P>
<DT>rename OLDHOSTNAME NEWHOSTNAME<DD>
Rename all data for a host that changes its name. You should do this
before changing the hostname in the bb-hosts configuration file.
<P>
<DT>rename HOSTNAME OLDTESTNAME NEWTESTNAME<DD>
Rename data about a single test (column).
<P>
<DT>hobbitdlog HOSTNAME.TESTNAME<DD>

Newline, pipe-signs and backslashes are escaped by with a backslash in C-style.
<P>
After the first line comes the full status log in plain text format.
<P>
<DT>hobbitdxlog HOSTNAME.TESTNAME<DD>
Retrieves an XML-string with the status log as for the 
&quot;hobbitdlog&quot; command.
<P>
<DT>hobbitdboard [CRITERIA] [fields=FIELDLIST]<DD>
Retrieves a summary of the status of all known tests available to
the Hobbit daemon. 
<P>
By default - if no CRITERIA is provided - it returns one line for all 
status messages that are found in Hobbit. You can filter the response
by selecting a page, a host, a test or a color - wildcards are not 
supported, so you can pick only one page, host, test or color. 
<P>
<B>page=PAGEPATH</B>

Include only tests from hosts found on the PAGEPATH page in the bb-hosts
file.
<P>
<B>host=HOSTNAME</B>

<P>
You can filter on e.g. both a hostname and a testname. 
<P>
The response is one line for each status that matches the CRITERIA,
or all statuses if no criteria is specified. The line is composed of
a number of fields, separated by a pipe-sign. You can select what
fields to retrieve by listing them in the FIELDLIST. The following

<DT>download FILENAME<DD>
Download a file from the Hobbit servers' download directory.
<P>
<DT>client HOSTNAME.OSTYPE [HOSTCLASS]<DD>
Used to send a &quot;client&quot; message to the Hobbit server. Client messages
are generated by the Hobbit client; when sent to the Hobbit server they
are matched against the rules in the
<I><A HREF="../man5/hobbit-clients.cfg.5.html">hobbit-clients.cfg</A>(5)</I>

configuration file, and status messages are generated for the client-side
tests.
<P>

for clients that cannot connect directly to the Hobbit server.
<P>
<DT>ghostlist<DD>
Report a list of <B>ghost</B> clients seen by the Hobbit server. Ghosts are systems
that report data to the Hobbit server, but are not listed in the bb-hosts file.
<P>
<DT>schedule [TIMESTAMP COMMAND]<DD>
Schedules an command sent to the Hobbit server for execution at a later time. E.g.
used to schedule disabling of a host or service at sometime in the future. COMMAND
is a complete Hobbit command such as the ones listed above. TIMESTAMP is the
Unix epoch time when the command will be executed.
<BR>

If no parameters are given, the currently scheduled tasks are listed in the response.
The response is one line per scheduled command, with the job-id, the time when the
command will be executed, the IP address from which this was sent, and the full command
string.
<BR>

To cancel an previously scheduled command, <B>&quot;schedule cancel JOBID&quot;</B> can be
used. JOBID is a number provided as the first item in the output from the schedule list.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLE</H2>

<P>
Send a normal status message to the BBDISPLAY server, using the
standard Hobbit protocol on TCP port 1984:
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$&nbsp;$BB&nbsp;$BBDISP&nbsp;&quot;status&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.foo.com.http">www.foo.com.http</A>&nbsp;green&nbsp;`date`&nbsp;Web&nbsp;OK&quot;
<P>
Send the same status message, but using HTTP protocol via the
webservers' bbmessage.cgi script:
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$&nbsp;$BB&nbsp;<A HREF="http://bb.foo.com/cgi-bin/bbmessage.cgi">http://bb.foo.com/cgi-bin/bbmessage.cgi</A>&nbsp;&quot;status&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.foo.com.http">www.foo.com.http</A>&nbsp;green&nbsp;`date`&nbsp;Web&nbsp;OK&quot;
<P>
Use &quot;query&quot; message to determine the color of the &quot;www&quot; test, and
restart Apache if it is red:
<BR>

<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$&nbsp;WWW=`$BB&nbsp;$BBDISP&nbsp;&quot;query&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.foo.com.www">www.foo.com.www</A>&quot;&nbsp;|&nbsp;awk&nbsp;'{print&nbsp;$1}'`
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$&nbsp;if&nbsp;[&nbsp;&quot;$WWW&quot;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&quot;red&quot;&nbsp;];&nbsp;then&nbsp;/etc/init.d/apache&nbsp;restart;&nbsp;fi
<P>
Use &quot;config&quot; message to update the local bb-dftab file (but only
if we get a response):
<BR>

<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$&nbsp;$BB&nbsp;$BBDISP&nbsp;&quot;config&nbsp;bb-dftab&quot;&nbsp;&gt;/tmp/bb-dftab.new
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$&nbsp;if&nbsp;[&nbsp;-s&nbsp;/tmp/bb-dftab.new&nbsp;];&nbsp;then&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mv&nbsp;/tmp/bb-dftab.new&nbsp;$BBHOME/etc/bb-dftab
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fi
<P>
Send a very large status message that has been built in the
file &quot;statusmsg.txt&quot;. Instead of providing it on the command line, 
pass it via stdin to the bb command:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$&nbsp;cat&nbsp;statusmsg.txt&nbsp;|&nbsp;$BB&nbsp;$BBDISP&nbsp;&quot;@&quot;
<P>

<H2>NOTES</H2>

This man-page describes the bb client program provided
as part of Hobbit . This implementation provides features 
not present in the standard Big Brother bb client - 
specifically, the support for sending messages over HTTP, 
and many commands such as &quot;query&quot; and &quot;config&quot; are not part 
of the bb client shipped with Big Brother.
