This branch is very diffrent in following ways.
1. Autoconfiscated xymon source.
2. doxygen to generate documenation from soucecode.
3. xymon slides and books using latex.
4. Use TWW tools to complete the xymon deployment lifecycle.
   ie, download,compile,install,packaging,uploading to depot server and then deployment.   
      This process is mostly digitized into XML language to be a repeatable process.
5. An attempt to enclose bbwin src tree. 
6. Some Xymon logo candidates.
